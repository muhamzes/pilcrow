# Progress

> ## ⏸ PAUSED MID-PHASE-6 — 2026-07-31
>
> **Read this block first. Delete it when Phase 6 is finished.**
>
> ### Where things stand
>
> **R2 and Resend credentials are in `.env.local` and they work.**
> `isStorageConfigured()` and `isEmailConfigured()` both return `true`, and a
> server-side round trip — presign → PUT → read back → delete → confirm gone —
> succeeded against the real bucket. **CORS is saved** (both origins, PUT/GET/HEAD,
> `content-type`) and **public access is disabled**, both confirmed by the owner.
>
> ### What passed — automated, re-run at pause
>
> | Gate | Result |
> | --- | --- |
> | `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
> | `verify:storage` | pass |
> | `verify:attachments` | pass — 33 |
> | `verify:email` | pass — templates only, **does not test delivery** |
> | `smoke` local | pass — 18 |
> | `smoke` production | pass — 19 |
> | `verify:all` | pass — 22 suites, 101s, clean before and after |
>
> The suite is genuinely exercising the configured path, not passing vacuously:
> `verify:storage` branches on `isStorageConfigured()`, and that branch flipped
> from *"a valid request reports storage as unconfigured (503)"* to **"a valid
> request returns an upload URL"** — only possible with working credentials.
>
> ### ⚠️ Phase 6 is nearly Done — one item left, and it needs your inbox
>
> **Updated 2026-08-02.** The paragraph that stood here said "no browser upload
> has ever completed". That is no longer true and is corrected rather than
> deleted: the owner added the six variables to Railway, and the full browser
> round trip is now verified **against production** — paperclip enabled, presign
> 200, a real cross-origin PUT returning 200, the message stored with its
> attachment, the model describing the image, the object read back. 9/9 in
> `npm run verify:upload -- --base=https://myaichat-production.up.railway.app`.
>
> **The one thing I cannot close is email delivery.** I can prove the template
> renders and the transport is configured; I cannot prove a message arrived.
> That is check 9 below, and it is the last item.
>
> ### The remaining human checks, in order
>
> Start the server (`npm run dev`), sign in, open a chat. **The paperclip should
> be enabled.** If it is greyed out, stop — a variable is missing or misspelled.
>
> | # | Check | Expect |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | 1 | ~~**Attach a PNG and send**~~ | ✅ **DONE 2026-08-02, by `npm run verify:upload`** — attaches in a real browser, PUTs to the bucket, stores the message with its attachment, reads the object back, and the model describes the image. It also found the real blocker: our CSP, not the bucket's CORS (ISSUE-038) |
> | 2 | Cloudflare → `myaichat` → Objects | The file under `chat/<your-user-id>/` — objects written by the production check are there now |
> | 3 | **Attach a 30MB file** | Rejected instantly, before any network request |
> | 4 | **Attach a `.exe`** | Rejected, message naming the accepted formats |
> | 5 | **Drag a file** onto the composer | "Drop to attach" overlay; dropping attaches |
> | 6 | **Paste a screenshot** (`⌘⇧4` then `⌘V`) | It attaches |
> | 7 | Attach two, **remove one** before sending | Chip goes; message sends with the other |
> | 8 | **Second user, 403** — sign in as another account, request `/api/uploads/download?key=<first user's key>` | 403/404. This is the check that proves a private bucket plus an ownership check actually compose |
> | 9 | **Test emails** — to the address that owns the Resend account | Welcome + password reset arrive; check on a phone too |
> | 10 | **Supabase SMTP** (checklist B5) | Route Supabase's own auth mail through Resend |
>
> If check 1 sticks on "Uploading…": devtools → Network → look for a failed
> `PUT` or a blocked preflight. That is CORS and nothing else, because the
> credentials were proven server-side before CORS was touched.
>
> ### Two gaps that are not bugs
>
> - ~~**Production does not have these credentials.**~~ **Done 2026-08-02** —
>   all six are in Railway, and uploads are verified working on the live site.
> - **`RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev`** is an unverified domain, so
>   Resend delivers **only to the Resend account owner's address**. Your own test
>   mail will arrive and every real user's will silently not. Correct for now;
>   blocks real signups until a domain is verified.
>
> ### First command when you resume
>
> ```bash
> git pull && npm install && npm run dev
> ```
>
> Then message me: **"Phase 6 human checks — starting check 1"** and I will walk
> them with you one at a time. Check 1 is already done; the one that actually
> needs you is **check 9**, and it is one signup on the live site with the
> address that owns the Resend account.

## Deployed

Live at **https://myaichat-production.up.railway.app** (Railway, US West), auto-deploying from `main`.
Verified in production 2026-07-30: health endpoint green, and the gates, chat, providers and admin
suites all pass against the live URL — not just localhost.

Deployment was pulled forward from Phase 8 at the user's request. Since 2026-07-31 a GitHub
Actions pipeline runs lint, type-check, format, build and the credential-free verification
suites on every push and pull request. Railway still deploys from `main` on its own — CI and
the deploy are not yet chained, so a red build does not *block* a deploy, it only reports one.
Closing that gap needs branch protection, which needs a paid plan on a private repo (ISSUE-018).

## Verification checklist (per phase)

A phase moves to **Verified** only when all four pass:

- [ ] `npm run lint`
- [ ] `npm run type-check`
- [ ] `npm run build`
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion in the phase file

---

## Phase 0 — Repo & docs setup · Verified · 2026-07-30

**Built**

- Git repo initialized, pushed to `github.com/MyChat99/myaichat` (private, default branch `main`)
- `.gitignore` covering secrets (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`), Node, Python, editor files, macOS
- Docs restructured to match the paths CLAUDE.md declares: `CLAUDE.md` at repo root, spec at `docs/00-PROJECT-SPEC.md`, the 8 phase files under `docs/phases/`
- Project wiki created at `docs/wiki/` (this file, ISSUES, DECISIONS, ROADMAP)
- `## Project wiki (mandatory)` section added to CLAUDE.md

**Verification**

- Structure confirmed against CLAUDE.md's stated layout — spec `@docs/00-PROJECT-SPEC.md` and `docs/phases/` references now resolve
- Lint / type-check / build: N/A — no application code or `package.json` yet

**Notes**

- No application code exists. Phase 1 starts from an empty scaffold.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation · Verified · 2026-07-30

**Built**

- Next.js 16.2.12 App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, ESLint, Prettier, shadcn/ui (`base-nova`, CSS variables), Framer Motion, Lucide, Zod, sonner
- Directory layout per CLAUDE.md: `/app`, `/components`, `/lib/{db,security,providers,r2}`, `/emails`, `/scripts`, `/supabase`
- Four migrations covering all 9 spec tables, 2 enums, 9 indexes, `updated_at` triggers, RLS on every table, `is_admin()`, `handle_new_user()`, `providers_public`
- Three Supabase clients — browser, cookie-bound server, and a `server-only` admin client using the secret key
- Email/password auth: signup, login, signout, `/auth/confirm` for emailed links; session refresh in `proxy.ts`
- Protected `(app)` shell with header, chat placeholder, role-gated `/admin` placeholder
- `.env.example` covering every variable through Phase 8; idempotent seed script
- Three verification scripts committed as evidence: `verify:schema`, `verify:rls`, `verify:gates`

**Verification**

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | pass |
| `npm run type-check` | pass |
| `npm run build` | pass — 6 routes |
| Migrations apply cleanly | pass — 4 migrations pushed to the hosted project; `verify:schema` confirms all 9 tables, the view, and `is_admin()` |
| RLS: user A cannot query user B | pass — `verify:rls`, 23 checks |
| Non-admin visiting /admin is redirected | pass — `verify:gates`, 7 checks over real HTTP, incl. admin-reaches-`/admin` as a control |
| Sign up → login → authenticated shell | pass — browser walkthrough on 2026-07-30: login → Welcome shell → /admin → sign out |
| Seed creates the admin + settings | pass — `verify:seed`; idempotent across 4 consecutive runs |

**Deviations from the phase file**

- `supabase db reset` was not run. It is Docker-only locally, and `--linked` would destroy the hosted database. Migrations were validated with `db push` from zero instead, which covers the same ground on an empty project. See [ISSUE-004](ISSUES.md).
- `middleware.ts` is `proxy.ts` — Next 16 renamed the convention and warns on the old name.
- `lib/db/types.ts` is hand-written; `supabase gen types` needs Docker. See [ISSUE-005](ISSUES.md).
- Provider secrets use column-level grants rather than RLS, which cannot hide a column. See [DEC-005](DECISIONS.md).

**Bugs found and fixed during the phase**

- [ISSUE-007](ISSUES.md) — recursive `profiles` UPDATE policy (`42P17`) broke every profile edit. Fixed in migration `20260730120004`.
- [ISSUE-008](ISSUES.md) — seed crashed on a null-valued `system_settings` row, leaving the database half-seeded. Fixed and made provably idempotent.
- [ISSUE-009](ISSUES.md) — `shadcn init` emitted a self-referential `--font-sans`, so every surface rendered in the browser's default serif instead of Geist. Caught by eye in the browser walkthrough, not by any automated check.

**Known cosmetic gaps** (deliberately not addressed in Phase 1)

- The shell is unstyled placeholder UI. Design work belongs to Phases 2, 5 and 7.

---

## Phase 2 — Chat interface with streaming · Verified · 2026-07-30

**Built**

- `/api/chat` route handler: authenticates, validates with Zod, rate-limits per user, streams from Anthropic and relays NDJSON. The provider key is read only inside a `server-only` module and never crosses to the client.
- `lib/providers/` — a `ChatProvider` interface plus the Anthropic adapter, already shaped so Phase 3 adds an adapter file rather than rewriting the route
- Persistence: both turns saved, token counts recorded, `usage_logs` written with estimated cost, conversation auto-titled from the first message
- UI: sidebar (create, rename, delete, pin, search, collapsible on mobile), thread view, auto-growing composer with Enter / Shift+Enter, typing indicator, scroll-to-bottom pill, 4 starter prompts, toast error states
- Message actions: copy, regenerate, edit-and-resubmit — the last two rewind the thread server-side via `truncateFromMessageId`
- Stop aborts the upstream request server-side; whatever was generated is kept rather than discarded
- Markdown rendered with `rehypeSanitize` **before** `rehypeHighlight`, so only markup we generate survives

**Verification** — `npm run verify:chat`, 25 checks

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | pass |
| `npm run type-check` | pass |
| `npm run build` | pass — 8 routes |
| Full streamed conversation | pass |
| Refresh restores history from the DB | pass — both turns persisted, content matches the stream byte for byte |
| XSS attempt renders inert | pass — script tags, inline handlers and `javascript:` URLs all stripped from the real component |
| Code blocks highlight | pass — `hljs` classes survive sanitization |
| Code blocks **copy** | pass — browser walkthrough 2026-07-30 |
| Stop halts generation immediately | pass — automated check asserts the persisted partial is short, i.e. the server stopped rather than finishing in the background; confirmed by hand too |
| Regenerate / edit-and-resubmit | pass |
| Responsive / mobile sidebar | pass — browser walkthrough 2026-07-30 |

**Deviations from the phase file**

- Provider is Anthropic as specified, but the model is `claude-opus-5` with thinking explicitly disabled ([DEC-008](DECISIONS.md)).
- Streaming uses NDJSON rather than SSE ([DEC-009](DECISIONS.md)).
- History is capped at the last 40 messages per request — dropped, not summarised. Compaction is a later concern.

**Bugs found and fixed during the phase**

- [ISSUE-011](ISSUES.md) — the proxy redirected unauthenticated API calls to the HTML login page, so `POST /api/chat` returned 200 and the handler's own 401 was unreachable.

**Carried into Phase 3** — done: the selected model's display name is now passed into the system prompt, so "which model are you?" is answerable.

---

## Phase 3 — Provider abstraction + model selector · Verified · 2026-07-30

**Built**

- `ChatProvider` interface with `streamChat()`, `listModels()`, `validateKey()`, plus a normalised `ProviderError` taxonomy (`auth`, `quota`, `rate_limit`, `context_length`, `network`, `provider`, `unknown`) the UI reacts to instead of vendor status codes
- Anthropic and OpenAI adapters, each the only file in the codebase that knows its vendor's API
- Registry mapping `providers`/`models` rows to adapters; `/api/chat` names no vendor and imports no vendor SDK
- Model selector in the chat header, grouped by provider, persisted to the conversation. Switching mid-conversation applies to subsequent messages.
- The selected model's display name is passed into the system prompt
- [lib/providers/README.md](../../lib/providers/README.md) documenting the add-a-provider path and the vendor differences the abstraction absorbs

**Verification** — `npm run verify:providers`, 20 checks

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| Same UX against both providers | pass — the same conversation flow streams from Anthropic and OpenAI |
| Switching models works | pass — automated at the API level, and confirmed in the browser 2026-07-30: switched Claude → GPT mid-conversation and the reply came from the new model |
| Third provider = one adapter file + DB rows | pass — enforced by `git grep`: no vendor SDK import and no provider name outside `lib/providers`. A passing two-provider chat does not prove this; an if/else in the route would pass that too. |
| `usage_logs` with correct token counts | pass — per provider, attributed to the right model, including after a mid-conversation switch |
| `/lib/providers/README.md` documents it | pass |

**Deviations from the phase file**

- Provider marks are lettermark badges, not vendor logos ([DEC-010](DECISIONS.md)).
- `listModels()` is implemented and tested but not yet wired to admin UI — model management is Phase 4's scope.

**Bugs found and fixed during the phase**

- [ISSUE-012](ISSUES.md) — the first OpenAI key authenticated but had no credit. Led to [DEC-011](DECISIONS.md): `validateKey()` must spend a token, never just list models.
- A 1-token validation probe failed on a healthy OpenAI key — OpenAI errors where Anthropic truncates. Documented in the provider README.

**Ready for Phase 4** — done: keys are now encrypted in the database and adapters take them by injection.

---

## Phase 4 — Admin panel · Verified · 2026-07-30

**Built**

- AES-256-GCM in `lib/security/crypto.ts`. Format `v1.<iv>.<tag>.<ciphertext>`, fresh random IV per encryption, authenticated so tampering throws rather than returning junk. The version prefix leaves room to rotate algorithms without a flag day.
- Adapters are now factories taking an API key; the registry resolves it from `providers.encrypted_api_key` and decrypts at call time, with an env-var fallback for a fresh local checkout. `getClient()` no longer reads `process.env`.
- `npm run keys:encrypt` moved both live keys into the encrypted column.
- Admin shell with Providers / Models / Users / Settings. Providers: masked key, rotate, delete, enable-disable, Test Connection with latency. Models: full CRUD plus "Fetch from provider". Users: search, promote/demote, suspend/activate. Settings: default model, global prompt, rate limit, upload cap, sign-ups.
- Audit logging on every mutation — actor, action, target, metadata, IP — written with the admin client because `audit_logs` has no client-facing insert policy. `redactMetadata()` is a backstop against a key ever reaching the trail.
- Suspension enforced in RLS as well as the route ([DEC-012](DECISIONS.md)), with a banner in the app shell.

**Verification** — `npm run verify:admin`, 40 checks

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| Keys never in plaintext in DB, client, or logs; masked in UI | pass — stored values are `v1.…` ciphertext, decrypt to real keys, only `key_last4` is clear. Round-trip, IV-uniqueness and tamper-rejection all asserted. |
| Test Connection distinguishes valid from invalid | pass — delegates to `validateKey()`, which generates rather than lists ([DEC-011](DECISIONS.md)) |
| Chat uses DB-stored encrypted keys | pass — proved by **breaking only the database value** and confirming chat fails. Had it kept working, that would have exposed a silent env-var fallback. |
| Disabling a provider hides its models | pass — model list shrinks and excludes that provider, then restores |
| Non-admins blocked from every /admin route | pass — all 5 routes × anon / non-admin / admin |
| …and from admin mutations | pass — structurally: every exported action calls `requireAdmin()`. Mutations are Server Actions, so CSRF is the framework's Origin check ([DEC-013](DECISIONS.md)). |
| Every admin action appears in audit_logs | pass — structurally asserted, and exercised in the browser walkthrough 2026-07-30 (Test Connection, provider toggle, settings save) |

**Deviations from the phase file**

- "Add provider" is not a UI affordance: a provider without a registered adapter cannot work, so providers come from the seed catalogue and the registry. The page names any adapter missing a database row.
- "Fetch from provider" lists the live catalogue rather than auto-inserting rows — the provider reports no cost or context data, and inserting models with zero costs would quietly corrupt the usage estimates.

**Bugs found and fixed during the phase**

- [ISSUE-013](ISSUES.md) — `lib/db/types.ts` drifted from the schema the moment a column was added, exactly as ISSUE-005 predicted. Caught by type-check.
- `verify:gates` broke when `/admin` became a redirecting index. The assertion now distinguishes an admin being forwarded *deeper into* admin from a non-admin being bounced *out of* it — the sloppy fix (accept any 307) would have made the test useless.

**Browser walkthrough** — 2026-07-30: Test Connection green on both providers, toggling a provider removed its models from the chat selector, and a settings change persisted across a reload.

---

## Phase 5 — Theming & appearance · Done · 2026-07-31

**NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — two criteria cannot be asserted without eyes on a
browser. Everything else is automated and passing.

**Built**

- Seven preset themes (Default, Midnight, Ocean, Forest, Sunset, Rose, Mono) as typed data in `lib/theme/presets.ts`, each with light and dark token sets. Adding a theme is one object — the CSS is generated, the contrast test picks it up, and the picker lists it with no other edits.
- Zero-flash application: both modes are emitted server-side and the resolved class is in the initial HTML. Only `system` needs the pre-paint inline script, which also follows OS changes mid-session.
- Appearance panel at `/settings` — mode, theme, eight accent swatches plus custom hex, three text sizes, Bubbles/Document message style, and a live preview that writes the *same generated CSS the server emits*.
- Custom accents derive a readable foreground automatically, with a live contrast ratio shown; a colour below AA says so rather than silently shipping unreadable buttons.
- No hardcoded colours left in components. Provider brand colours moved to `lib/theme/brand.ts` as data (deliberately not themeable); success states became a token; syntax highlighting derives from theme variables.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured globally; the cross-fade transitions only colour properties.

**Verification**

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| All themes pass AA contrast | pass — `verify:theme`, **134 pairings** across 7 themes × 2 modes, including muted text and both semantic colours |
| Preferences persist across refresh and devices | pass — `verify:appearance`, 15 checks; a second request is a different device to the server |
| No flash of wrong theme | pass **for explicit light/dark** — asserted by finding the theme in the server-rendered HTML. `system` mode resolves in a pre-paint script; **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** that no flash is perceptible. |
| Smooth animated cross-fade | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — motion cannot be asserted headlessly |
| Six preset themes minimum | pass — seven |
| No hardcoded colours remain | pass — grep finds none outside the brand data file |

**Deviations from the phase file**

- The phase file's token names (`background`, `surface`, `accent`, …) are the authoring vocabulary in `presets.ts`, but they are *emitted* as the shadcn variable names the app already used. This was the smallest possible change to working Phase 1–4 code — no component had to be edited to become themeable. ⚠️ Note the collision: shadcn's `--accent` is a hover surface, so the brand accent maps to `--primary`.
- Semantic colours (`destructive`, `success`) are intentionally consistent across themes. A green that turns orange in one theme stops reading as "success".

**To reach Verified**

Open `/settings`, switch themes and modes, and confirm: no flash on reload (especially with the OS set to dark and mode set to System), and that the cross-fade looks smooth rather than janky.

---

## Phase 6 — R2 uploads + Resend emails · Partial · 2026-07-31

**Superseded 2026-08-02 — no longer blocked.** R2 is configured and verified end
to end against production ([ISSUE-016](ISSUES.md), Resolved). Resend is
configured; only its delivery leg is unproven, because the sending domain is
unverified and Resend will deliver solely to the account owner
([ISSUE-017](ISSUES.md), Open).

The paragraph below is the original 2026-07-31 entry, kept for the record:

> **BLOCKED ON CREDENTIALS.** R2 and Resend are unconfigured, so the happy paths
> are unverified. Everything up to the integration point is built and tested.

**Built and verified**

- `lib/r2/storage.ts` — presigned upload/download against a private bucket. Object keys are namespaced by user id, making ownership a string comparison and preventing a leaked key from being walked to another user's files.
- `/api/uploads/presign` validates auth → suspension → rate limit → MIME allow-list → size, and only then touches storage. Every rejection is testable without credentials.
- `/api/uploads/download` returns a 302 to a short-lived presigned GET, after an ownership check that 404s (not 403s) on someone else's key — a 403 confirms the file exists.
- Attachments through the provider abstraction: `ChatAttachment` is optional on `ChatMessage`, so no existing call site changed. Anthropic gets content blocks, OpenAI gets `image_url` parts.
- Model capabilities (`supports_vision`, `supports_documents`) live in the database. A model that cannot read an image returns **422 with a clear message** rather than dropping the file and answering as though it had seen it.
- Four React Email templates with dark-mode support, inline styles, and every action link repeated as copyable text.
- Profile page: display name and avatar upload, avatars served through our route rather than a bucket URL.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| Unauthorised / oversized / wrong-type uploads rejected server-side | pass — `verify:storage`, 16 checks |
| Direct bucket URLs do not work | pass **by construction** — no code path returns a public URL, and downloads go through an ownership-checked route. **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** that the bucket itself is created private. |
| Upload → send → model receives the attachment | **NEEDS CREDENTIALS** — cannot be exercised without R2 |
| All four emails render well in light and dark clients | pass for *structure* — `verify:email`, 23 checks (dark-mode styles, inline CSS, no stranded white text). **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** of actual rendering in Gmail/Outlook. |
| All four emails send | **NEEDS CREDENTIALS** — console transport only |

**Not done**

- **Composer attachment UX** (task 2): the upload helper and API exist, but the attach button, drag-and-drop and chip previews are NOT wired into the chat composer. Deliberate — building an attachment UI that cannot upload anything would be unverifiable, and I would rather leave it clearly missing than half-present. This is the first thing to finish once R2 credentials exist.
- **Supabase auth emails routed through Resend** (task 7): a dashboard SMTP change, not code. See ISSUE-017.

---

## Phase 7 — Analytics, audit UI, polish · Partial · 2026-07-31

Three of eight tasks done to completion. The rest were **deliberately not
started** rather than half-built — see below.

**Built and verified**

- **Analytics** (`/admin/analytics`): messages per day, tokens by model, cost by provider, active users; 7/30/90-day ranges. Aggregated server-side — sending 10k raw rows to the browser to group them is precisely what makes such dashboards collapse as data grows. A 50,000-row ceiling bounds memory and the page *says so* when hit rather than silently showing a subset.
- **Audit log** (`/admin/audit`): filterable by action, paginated, actor emails resolved in one round trip.
- **Security headers** (task 6): CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy — all confirmed present over HTTP.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| Dashboards render real data | pass — charts read live `usage_logs` |
| …and stay fast with 10k+ rows | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — the aggregation is server-side and bounded, but there are only ~40 usage rows in this database, so the claim is architectural rather than measured |
| Keyboard-only operation end to end | **NOT VERIFIED** — needs a human at a keyboard |
| Lighthouse ≥90 perf / ≥95 a11y | **NOT MEASURED** — needs a browser |

**Not started (deliberately)**

- Task 3 (Framer Motion animation pass), task 4 (command palette + shortcuts modal), task 5 (error boundaries — toasts already exist from Phase 2), task 7 (performance pass), task 8 (accessibility audit).
- These are the diffuse, visual tasks. Their acceptance criteria are Lighthouse scores and a keyboard walkthrough, neither of which I can measure headlessly — so building them tonight would have produced code I could not verify and you could not trust. `prefers-reduced-motion` and the theme cross-fade landed in Phase 5, so the accessibility floor for motion is already in place.

**Note on CSP**

`script-src` includes `'unsafe-inline'`. This is not laziness: the pre-paint theme
resolver in `app/layout.tsx` is an inline script, and a nonce cannot be applied to
it without reintroducing the flash Phase 5 exists to eliminate. The trade is
documented at the top of `next.config.ts`. Removing it would require moving theme
resolution to a cookie read in `proxy.ts` — possible, and worth doing if CSP
strictness ever matters more than the flash.

## Session 2 — Priority 1 & 2 · 2026-07-31

Overnight work, additive only. Nothing in Phases 1–4 was modified.

### Priority 1 — Phase 8 groundwork · Done

- **CI pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): three jobs. `quality` runs lint,
  type-check, format:check and build **with no secrets present** — which also
  proves the lazy-env fix from ISSUE-014 holds, since a build that needed runtime
  credentials would fail here. `tests` runs only the credential-free suites.
  `security` runs the audit non-blocking.
- **Railway deploy job is present but DISABLED** (`if: false`), by instruction and
  because Railway already auto-deploys from GitHub — enabling both would race two
  deploys against one another. The comment in the file lists the exact three steps
  to switch over.
- **`/api/health`**: already existed from the deployment work; now exercised by CI.
- **`SECURITY.md`**: security model, the four authorisation layers, and incident
  checklists for a leaked provider key, a leaked master key, a compromised account
  and an exposed database.
- **`README.md`**: setup, scripts, architecture summary.
- **`.github/dependabot.yml`**: weekly npm updates grouped production/development,
  monthly Actions. Majors for `next`/`react`/`react-dom` arrive individually rather
  than inside a group, so a framework major is never buried in a batch.
- **`scripts/security-audit.ts`** (`npm run security:audit`): secret-shape grep over
  tracked files, `npm audit` parsing, and an RLS check that reads the **pg catalog**
  through a new `rls_status()` function rather than trusting that migrations ran.

**NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION**

- Branch protection could not be enabled — GitHub returns 403 for rulesets on a
  private repo without a paid plan (ISSUE-018). Three options are written up there;
  the decision is yours.
- Two Dependabot PRs (#5 typescript 7, #6 eslint 10) fail CI for a real upstream
  reason, not a flake — `eslint-config-next` bundles a react plugin incompatible
  with ESLint 10. Recommendation: close both (ISSUE-019).

### Priority 2 — Interface polish · Done, visually unverified

- **Motion primitives** (`components/motion/motion.tsx`): message entrance, overlay
  and panel variants, press feedback. Every one consults `useReducedMotion()`, and
  when it is on the duration collapses to **zero**, not merely shorter — a fast
  animation is still animation, and that setting exists for people for whom that is
  the problem.
- **Command palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl+K`) with new chat, appearance, profile, model
  switching and conversation search; `?` opens a shortcuts modal. Written without
  `cmdk` on purpose: the surface is one filtered list, and the focus-trap and
  focus-restore behaviour is the actual work — worth owning rather than inheriting.
  `?` is ignored while typing, or a question mark could never be typed anywhere.
- **Error boundaries**: `app/error.tsx`, `app/global-error.tsx`, `app/not-found.tsx`
  and a shared `ErrorState`. The boundary never renders `error.message` — in
  production Next replaces it with a digest anyway, and in development it carries
  internals no user should read — but it *does* show the digest, which is the string
  that makes a support report traceable to a server log. `global-error.tsx` uses
  inline styles and a neutral palette because the layout that defines the theme
  tokens is precisely what has failed by the time it renders.
- **Security headers hardened** (`next.config.ts`), **CSP deliberately untouched** —
  that decision is the owner's. Added: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`,
  `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`, `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off`, a
  twelve-feature `Permissions-Policy` deny list, and `Cache-Control: no-store` on
  `/api/*`. `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` was **not** added: `require-corp` would
  demand CORP headers from every third-party resource, which Supabase-hosted avatars
  do not send, so it would break images to buy isolation this app does not need.
- **`npm run verify:headers`** (24 checks) asserts all of the above against
  `next.config.ts` and runs in CI. It reports the `unsafe-inline` exception as a note
  rather than a failure, so the known trade stays visible without going red.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| `verify:headers` | pass — 24/24 |
| `verify:theme` / `appearance` / `gates` / `rls` / `providers` / `admin` | pass |
| Palette opens on ⌘K, arrows and Enter work | **Verified** 2026-07-31 by owner |
| Animations feel right, and stop under reduced motion | **Verified** 2026-07-31 by owner |
| Error and 404 pages look correct | **Verified** 2026-07-31 by owner |

### Priority 3 — Security hardening · Done & verified

- **Login throttling** — new `auth_attempts` table (migration `20260731130001`),
  five failures per account or thirty per IP in fifteen minutes. Two counters,
  because a per-account limit never trips under password spraying and a per-IP
  limit alone punishes shared networks. Stored identifiers are HMACed so the
  table is not an email list. See DEC-013.
- **Signup hardening** — 10-character minimum, a common/repetitive/email-derived
  password blocklist, and a disposable-domain blocklist. Composition rules were
  deliberately not added; see DEC-014, including why the *login* path keeps the
  old 8-character minimum (raising it there locks existing users out of their
  own accounts at form validation).
- **Re-authentication for provider key changes** — `setProviderKey` and
  `deleteProviderKey` now require the admin's password, verified server-side on
  a throwaway client and throttled under its own counter. See DEC-012.
- **Per-user daily token budget** — `system_settings.daily_token_budget_per_user`
  (0 = unlimited, the default), enforced in `/api/chat` from `usage_logs` since
  00:00 UTC, and editable in `/admin/settings`. It sits beside the hourly message
  limit rather than replacing it: one is a pace limit, the other a spend ceiling,
  and sixty messages an hour of very large context is a bill the message counter
  never sees.
- **`npm run verify:security`** — 35 checks across all four. Excluded from CI for
  the ISSUE-015 reason: it temporarily writes a system setting and restores it in
  `finally`, and there is one Supabase project behind local and production.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| `verify:security` | pass — 35/35 |
| `security:audit` | pass — all **10** public tables have RLS |
| Throttle blocks after 5 failures, clears on success | pass — asserted against stored rows |
| `auth_attempts` unreadable with the publishable key | pass |
| Over-budget user is refused by the chat route | pass — asserted via `checkDailyTokenBudget` on a real user with real usage |
| The password prompt appears when rotating a key | **Verified** 2026-07-31 by owner — wrong password rejected, correct password accepted |

### Priority 4 — Frontend polish · Done, visually unverified

- **Message list windowing** — the list mounts the most recent 60 messages with
  a "Show N earlier messages" control, and rows more than six from the bottom
  carry `content-visibility: auto` so the browser skips their layout and paint.
  A real virtualiser was **rejected**: react-window and friends position rows
  absolutely from measured heights, which fights markdown rows of unknown height
  and a final row that grows on every streamed token. The failure mode there is
  a scroll position that jumps mid-response — worse than the problem being
  solved. Windowing gets the same bounded DOM with none of that risk.
- **Loading skeletons** — `loading.tsx` for the conversation, admin, settings and
  profile routes, shaped like the content they replace so nothing jolts when the
  real markup lands. Each sits in a `role="status"` live region, so a screen
  reader hears "loading" rather than a wall of empty boxes.
- **Favicon and OG metadata** — `app/icon.svg`, a generated `favicon.ico` and
  `apple-icon.png` (replacing the create-next-app defaults), plus a generated
  `opengraph-image` and full Open Graph / Twitter metadata. `metadataBase` is set,
  without which Next emits **relative** og:image URLs that no crawler resolves —
  the card would have silently never appeared. `robots: noindex` because a
  private chat app has nothing to gain from being indexed.
- **Title template fixed** — adding `template: '%s · myaichat'` would have turned
  every existing page title into "Profile · myaichat · myaichat"; all six page
  titles were shortened in the same change.
- **Mobile** — the header nav now wraps instead of overflowing (at 360px the four
  links plus the sign-out button do not fit on one line, and an overflowing
  header puts a horizontal scrollbar on the whole page). The sidebar drawer,
  admin tab strip and audit table already had mobile handling from earlier phases.
- **Profile** — an Account card showing email, role, member-since and status.
  The date is formatted with a fixed locale and UTC, because a server-rendered
  date that follows the server's locale is a hydration mismatch waiting to happen.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| `verify:theme` / `verify:appearance` | pass |
| Icons render correctly | pass — generated PNG inspected directly |
| OG card renders | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — route builds; the image itself is unseen |
| Skeletons match the real layout | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** |
| Mobile layout at 360px | **Verified** 2026-07-31 by owner — header wraps, no horizontal scroll |
| Windowing at 60+ messages | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — no conversation here is that long |

### Priority 5 — Test depth · Done

- **`npm run verify:authz`** (36 checks) — a *completeness* check, and that is
  the point. Every runtime suite proves the endpoints it knows about are gated;
  none can notice a **new** Server Action shipped without one, because a test
  only covers what someone remembered to write. This walks the source: every
  exported action, every route handler, every admin page. Public routes need a
  written reason to be exempt. Runs credential-free in CI.
  - Writing it surfaced two ways a naive version lies: a return type of
    `Promise<{ ok: true }>` makes brace-matching stop at the *type's* brace, so
    a well-gated action reads as ungated; and a gate reached through a local
    helper (`createConversation` → `insertConversation` → `requireUser`) is a
    real gate. Both are handled, and both produced false failures first.
- **Rate limit and token budget** now covered in `verify:security` (42 checks):
  exact message counting, assistant replies correctly *not* counted, the cutoff
  at the configured limit, and the budget refusal for a user with real usage.
  Both temporarily change a system setting and restore it in `finally`.
- **`npm run smoke`** — 18 checks against a *running* server, which is a
  different question from everything else in `scripts/`. It found a real bug on
  its first run: `/opengraph-image` was being redirected to `/login` by the
  proxy, so no link-preview crawler — all of which are anonymous — could ever
  have fetched the card. Fixed in `lib/db/session.ts`.
- **`verify:providers` exemption** — the password blocklist contains 'anthropic'
  and 'openai', which the no-vendor-names scan flagged. Exempted as one named
  file with a reason, not a pattern: a string table is not a branch on vendor.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:authz` | pass — 36/36 |
| `verify:security` | pass — 42/42 |
| `smoke` (local production build) | pass — 18/18 |
| `verify:gates` / `rls` / `appearance` / `providers` / `admin` / `theme` / `headers` | pass |
| `smoke` against the live Railway URL | **NOT RUN** — the standing instruction was not to touch production tonight. Run `npm run smoke -- --url https://myaichat-production.up.railway.app` when you are ready; it is read-only and sends no chat message. |

### Priority 6 — Documentation · Done

- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — system diagram, chat and sign-in sequence
  diagrams, an ER diagram, the authorisation-layer chain and the secret
  lifecycle, all in Mermaid so they render on GitHub without an image to keep in
  step. Written to explain the non-obvious decisions rather than restate the file
  tree: why NDJSON instead of SSE, why a foreign conversation 404s instead of
  403s, why the user message is written before the provider call, why adapters
  are factories rather than singletons.
- **`lib/providers/README.md`** — rewritten as five concrete steps. The previous
  version documented a shape the code no longer has (a `ChatProvider` singleton;
  adapters have been key-taking factories since Phase 3), which is worse than no
  document — someone following it would have written an adapter that closes over
  a key that rotation then invalidates.

---

## Away session — Priority 2 · Phase 6 attachment UI · 2026-07-31

Phase 6's one unfinished task (composer attachment UX) is now built. It is
**fully wired against the real presign route** — the only step that cannot run
is the PUT to R2, which needs credentials.

- **`components/chat/attachments.tsx`** — file picker, drag-and-drop with a
  drop overlay, **paste-to-attach** (screenshots arrive on the clipboard far
  more often than through a picker), image thumbnails from object URLs,
  per-file progress and per-file errors, remove-before-send.
- **The paperclip is disabled with a reason** when storage is unconfigured,
  rather than failing on click. `isStorageConfigured()` is read server-side and
  passed down — the client cannot determine this for itself.
- **One accepted-type table** (`lib/upload/types.ts`) imported by both the
  composer and the server-only storage module. Previously the list lived behind
  `server-only`, so a client copy would have been the only option — and two
  copies drift into the worst failure mode there is: the picker accepts a file,
  the upload starts, and the server rejects it with an error the user cannot act
  on.
- **Uploads are concurrent and fail individually.** A failed chip stays on
  screen in an error state; removing it silently would look like it attached.
- **Send is blocked while any upload is in flight**, and a message with an
  attachment but no text is valid — "what is this?" is implied by the picture.
- **`npm run verify:attachments`** — 33 credential-free checks, wired into CI.
  Covers every rejection path (executables, SVG, HTML, zips, video, empty files,
  oversized, missing MIME), the wording of each message, and two contract
  assertions: that the per-message cap matches the chat route's `.max(5)`, and
  that SVG and HTML are absent from the allow-list. An SVG is an image to a user
  and a script host to a browser; serving one from our own origin is stored XSS.

**`docs/wiki/PHASE-6-CHECKLIST.md`** is the sequence for when credentials land:
exact env var names, the R2 bucket settings that must be verified by a human
(public access **off**, CORS including `content-type`), the Resend test-mode
trap that makes your own emails arrive and everyone else's silently not, and the
verification order. Nothing in it requires a code change.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |
| `verify:attachments` | pass — 33/33 |
| `verify:storage` | pass — rejection paths hold |
| Picker, drag-drop, paste, remove all behave | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** (as of 2026-07-31) |
| The PUT to R2 | **Resolved 2026-08-02** — verified against production, `verify:upload` 9/9 (ISSUE-016) |

## Away session — Priority 3 · Adversarial self-review · 2026-07-31

Read Phases 1–7 as a hostile reviewer looking for authorisation gaps,
unvalidated input, races, missing RLS, leaky errors and dead code.

**One high-severity bug found and fixed — [ISSUE-023](ISSUES.md).** The chat
route sent the model the **oldest** forty messages rather than the newest, so
past forty turns it never saw the question just asked. Nothing errored; the only
symptom was an assistant that appeared to lose the thread on long conversations,
which reads as a model limitation rather than our bug. The longest conversation
here is 31 messages, so it had not surfaced yet.

**One structural issue logged, not fixed — [ISSUE-024](ISSUES.md).** Truncation
deletes by `created_at >=`, and `now()` is transaction time, so colliding
timestamps would over-delete. The correct fix is a sequence column plus a
migration and changes to every read path that assumes `created_at` ordering —
structural, so logged per the standing instruction.

**Checked and found sound:** `keyBelongsToUser` prefix matching (fixed-length
UUIDs plus a trailing slash, so no prefix confusion); self-demotion and
self-suspension guards on the admin actions; the 404-not-403 choice on foreign
resources; every mutation running through the RLS-bound client rather than the
admin client; error responses carrying no internals.

**`npm run verify:api` — 47 checks, refusals only.** Every route now has tests
proving it rejects: no session, malformed body, out-of-schema values, another
user's resource. Two assertions carry more weight than the rest:

- **Status *and* content type.** ISSUE-011 was an unauthenticated POST returning
  200 with an HTML login page — a test checking only "not 2xx" would have passed
  it, and one checking only status would have missed JSON callers getting HTML.
- **A foreign conversation is byte-identical to a missing one.** Otherwise the
  difference between 403 and 404 is an existence oracle.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:api` | pass — 47/47 |
| `verify:attachments` | pass — 33/33 |
| Every API route has a rejection test | done — chat, presign, download, health |
| Every admin page refuses a non-admin | pass — all 7 |
| History-window regression is guarded | pass |

## Away session — Priority 4 · Export and demo data · 2026-07-31

- **Conversation export** — `GET /api/conversations/:id/export?format=md|json`,
  with `.md` / `.json` links in the chat header. Plain anchors rather than
  fetch-and-Blob: the browser already knows how to save a response carrying a
  `content-disposition` header, and doing it by hand means holding the whole
  export in memory first. Markdown writes "You" and the model's display name
  rather than `user`/`assistant`, because the file is read by a person and
  usually pasted somewhere else. Attachment **names** are listed but not linked
  — the bytes sit behind a signed URL that expires, so a link would be dead
  before anyone opened the file.
- **`npm run seed -- --demo`** — 52 conversations, 164 messages and 82 usage
  rows spread across 30 days, so the analytics ranges (7/30/90) actually differ
  and the charts are not three flat lines. Weekday volume varies, because a
  chart of uniform bars looks as fake as it is.
  - **Flag-gated, and refuses to run twice.** It writes fabricated usage rows,
    and a fabricated row is indistinguishable from a real one the moment it
    lands — it will be counted in spend and in every future report. Everything
    is tagged `[demo]` and `--clean-demo` removes exactly what it added.
  - Timestamps are written explicitly and spaced. A bulk insert otherwise lands
    every row on one transaction-time `now()`, which would flatten the charts
    *and* manufacture the collision described in ISSUE-024.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:api` | pass — 61/61, now covering export refusals **and** a real download |
| Export downloads rather than rendering | pass — asserted on `content-disposition` |
| `seed --demo` is gated and idempotent | pass — plain `seed` writes none; a second `--demo` run skips |
| Charts look right with demo data | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — data is in, appearance unchecked |

## Session pause — 2026-07-31

Closing state, for the record.

**Branch protection is live and enforcing.** `main` requires a pull request with
both blocking CI jobs green; force pushes and deletions are blocked; and
**administrators are bound**, which is what makes it enforcement rather than
decoration on a single-maintainer repository. Proven in both directions — a
direct push is rejected with `GH006`, and PR #7 merged cleanly through the
intended path. See [ISSUE-018](ISSUES.md) and [DEC-016](DECISIONS.md).

Phase 8 moves from **Partial** to **Done**: CI runs on every push and pull
request, and now *gates* merges rather than only reporting. It is not **Verified**,
because one acceptance criterion is unmet on purpose — CI and the Railway deploy
are still unchained, so deploys are always CI-green but are not themselves
gated. That is a decision waiting on you, not an unfinished task.

**Three stale issues corrected during the pause audit**, all found by reading
rather than by any check:

- **ISSUE-010** was marked Open for a full day after it was fixed. Phase 2 shipped
  on 2026-07-30 and the log never caught up. An issue log that lags reality is
  worse than none, because the next person plans around a blocker that no longer
  exists.
- **ISSUE-003** listed Railway alongside R2 and Resend; Railway has been live
  since 2026-07-30. Rescoped to Phase 6 credentials only.
- **ISSUE-001** is resolved and now verifiable: with the repo public, the API
  confirms every commit is linked to the `MyChat99` profile.

**Nothing is in progress.** No partial work, no stash, no open branch. The resume
point is at the top of this file.

## Away session 3 — Priority 1 · Queue cleared · 2026-07-31

**All four Dependabot PRs merged**, each through the protected-branch flow with
CI green on its own head commit. No `--admin` bypass was used at any point; the
protection applied yesterday was left to do its job, which meant re-updating and
re-running each branch as the ones ahead of it landed.

| PR | Bump | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1 | `actions/setup-node` 5 → 7 | merged — v7.0.0 confirmed current major |
| #2 | `actions/checkout` 5 → 7 | merged — v7.0.1 confirmed current major |
| #4 | `@types/node` 20 → 26 | merged |
| #3 | `react` / `react-dom` → 19.2.8 | merged |

**PR #3 was failing, and not for the reason it appeared to be.** It reported a
build failure on a react bump; the actual cause was `format:check` on a file that
had nothing to do with react. Its branch had been cut from `e8d555a`, a commit
where `main` itself was red — see [ISSUE-026](ISSUES.md). Updating the branch to
current `main` turned it green with no change to the bump.

That is worth stating plainly: **`main` was red for about forty minutes during
the last away session and I reported the commit as pushed and green.** It was
pushed. It was not green. Branch protection now makes that impossible — a merge
is blocked until the required checks pass *on that exact commit* — so the fix is
already in place structurally rather than depending on me remembering.

**[ISSUE-027](ISSUES.md) written and deliberately NOT applied**: the exact steps,
tradeoffs and a recommendation for gating the Railway deploy on CI. The
recommendation is *not yet* — branch protection already closed almost all of the
gap, and the remaining cost is a production-capable token in GitHub secrets plus
a second, unproven build path.

**Open issues reviewed for code-resolvability.** Of those still open: ISSUE-003,
-016 and -017 are credentials; -004, -005 and -006 need Docker or a Next
downgrade; -015 needs a separate CI database; -022 is a decision. Only
[ISSUE-024](ISSUES.md) is genuinely code-resolvable — handled separately so the
migration lands on its own.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Four PRs merged, CI green on each head SHA | pass |
| No admin bypass used | pass |
| Full suite after all bumps | pass — 17 suites, nothing regressed |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `format:check` / `build` | pass |

## Away session 3 — ISSUE-024 resolved · message sequence · 2026-07-31

The one genuinely code-resolvable open issue. Truncation for regenerate and
edit-and-resubmit deleted by `created_at >=`, and `now()` is transaction time —
so several rows written by one statement share a value and the boundary was
ambiguous. Regenerating an assistant reply could delete the question that
prompted it.

Migration `20260731140001` adds `messages.seq` (monotonic) and the truncation,
history window, title derivation, thread render and export all order by it.
`created_at` stays as the display timestamp and is no longer load-bearing for
order.

The backfill is the part worth reviewing: it orders by `(created_at, id)` rather
than letting `bigserial` number rows in physical order, because physical order
on an updated table is not insertion order — the lazy version would have quietly
reshuffled existing conversations.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Migration applied and confirmed | pass |
| `verify:api` | pass — 65/65, four of them the new collision case |
| Full DB suite incl. `verify:chat` | pass — nothing regressed |

## Away session 3 — Priority 2a · Session hardening · 2026-07-31

**The finding is the headline.** Refresh-token rotation was assumed to be in
force because Supabase rotates by default. It does rotate — and it does **not**
invalidate the old token. Measured by simulating a theft: a token replayed
twenty seconds after rotation was accepted, and the legitimate session survived
untouched, so the theft leaves no trace. Filed as **[ISSUE-028](ISSUES.md)**
(High). It is a Supabase dashboard setting, so no code here can fix it — which
is exactly why it needed measuring rather than assuming.

Signing out *does* invalidate the token; that is asserted and passing. So the
exposure is bounded by the user signing out, which most people never do.

**`npm run verify:session`** — 25 checks. Reports the rotation state as a loud
warning rather than a failure, because it describes a configuration no change in
this repository can turn green, and a permanently red suite is one people stop
reading. `-- --strict` promotes it to a failure, so the moment the setting is
fixed it can be pinned there. The pure half runs credential-free in CI.

**Idle session expiry** — `system_settings.session_idle_timeout_minutes`,
**default 0 (off)**. Enforced in the proxy, and honest about its limits: it
clears our own cookie and does not revoke the Supabase refresh token, so it
shortens the window on an unlocked or shared machine and does nothing against
someone who has already copied the cookie jar.

Three decisions in it worth keeping:

- **Default off.** This code runs on the auth path, where a mistake signs out
  every user at once. Shipping it inert means the risky part only ever runs
  after a deliberate choice.
- **An absent marker is `unmarked`, never `expired`.** Otherwise enabling the
  setting would log out everyone on their next request — asserted directly.
- **The marker is HMAC-signed**, so it can be deleted but not forward-dated.
  Without that, keeping a stale session alive forever is a one-line cookie edit.
  A forward-dated marker is tested and rejected.

The setting is read through a 60-second module-scope cache and **fails open** on
any error — a database hiccup must not sign out the whole application.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:session` | pass — 25 checks, 2 warnings that are the finding |
| Full suite | pass — 17 suites, nothing regressed |
| Idle expiry is inert by default | pass — asserted, and the seed writes 0 |

## Away session 3 — Priority 2c · Re-auth on privileged actions · 2026-07-31

Password confirmation extended from provider keys to the two remaining actions
that a stolen session should not be able to perform alone:

- **`setUserRole`** — the widest escalation available in one click. A new admin
  can read every provider key's last4, change models, suspend accounts, and
  promote further users.
- **`deleteModel`** — destructive and not obviously reversible: conversations
  pinned to that model fall back to the default, and its usage rows lose cost
  attribution.

Both now route through `requireAdminWithPassword()`, which verifies on a
throwaway client (so a confirmation cannot silently re-issue session cookies)
and is throttled under its own counter (so the field is not a password oracle).

**`components/admin/confirm-password.tsx`** is the shared prompt. The
provider-key form keeps its own inline fields — it works, and rewriting working
code to share a component is not a good enough reason. This exists because the
*third* bespoke copy was the point to stop.

One React detail worth recording: the dialog's state lives in an inner component
that **mounts fresh per request**, rather than an effect that clears the password
when the request changes. The effect version is `setState` inside an effect body
— a cascading render, and correctly refused by the rules-of-hooks lint.

**Completeness check, not just a behaviour check.** `verify:admin` now asserts
that every privileged action takes a password parameter, calls
`requireAdminWithPassword`, and *returns* the failure rather than throwing —
Next replaces thrown Server Action errors with a generic message in production,
so a thrown "that password is not correct" reaches the user as "an error
occurred". A privileged action added later without re-auth fails this.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:admin` | pass — 13 new completeness assertions |
| Full suite | pass — nothing regressed |
| The dialog appears and rejects a wrong password | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — server gate tested, screen unseen |

## Away session 3 — Priority 2d · Per-endpoint rate limits · 2026-07-31

The upload routes were rate-limited by **counting their own `audit_logs` rows**.
That coupled two unrelated things: an audit trail is a permanent record, a rate
limit is a rolling window. Pruning one damaged the other, and changing what got
audited silently changed the limit. Downloads had **no limit at all**, because
nothing audited them and there was therefore nothing to count.

New `api_usage` table (migration `20260731150001`, deny-all RLS) and
`lib/security/endpoint-limit.ts`:

| Endpoint | Per minute | Per hour | Why this shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `uploads.presign` | 20 | 120 | Each call mints a **writable credential** valid for five minutes. The size limit is per-URL, so the only thing bounding total bytes is how many URLs you can get |
| `uploads.download` | 60 | 600 | Signs a read and bills R2 egress; a gallery legitimately fetches many at once |
| `conversations.export` | 10 | 60 | Reads and serialises a whole conversation — cheap once, not in a loop |

**Two windows per endpoint, deliberately.** A single hourly cap permits emptying
the whole budget in three seconds; a single per-minute cap permits that burst
every minute all day. `verify:storage` asserts `perMinute < perHour` for every
entry, so a future endpoint cannot be added with only one of them.

Attempts are recorded **before** the work, not after. The alternative rewards
failure: a client making a thousand erroring requests would be charged for none
of them, which is exactly the shape of an abusive client.

### A flaw found in an existing check while doing this

`verify:admin` verified admin gating by reading **`git show HEAD:`** — the last
commit, not the working tree. It therefore validated the past: a missing gate
passed locally and only failed after it had already merged, which is the
opposite of what a pre-commit check is for. It also matched `requireAdmin()`
literally, so the four actions using the *stricter*
`requireAdminWithPassword()` were counted as ungated for being more careful.

Both fixed. This is why the check failed for the first time in this session
despite the change landing in the previous one.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:storage` | pass — 13 new limit assertions |
| `security:audit` | pass — 11 tables, `api_usage` deny-all by design |
| Full suite | pass — nothing regressed |

## Away session 3 — Priority 2e · Dependency audit as its own job · 2026-07-31

Split the dependency check out of the existing `security` job. They answer
unrelated questions — `security` checks **our** code (committed secrets, RLS
coverage), this checks a tree we mostly do not control — and merging them meant
one red badge for two problems with different answers to "is this actionable?".

**`npm run audit:report`** renders `npm audit --json` as Markdown, split into
**Direct** and **Transitive**. That split is the whole point: a transitive
advisory four levels under `next` is not something a maintainer here can fix,
and mixing it with an actionable one is what makes audit output read as noise.

Two details it surfaces that the raw summary line does not:

- **Advisory count is down from 12 to 3**, from this session's dependency bumps.
  The "12 high advisories" figure quoted in ISSUE-006 and several earlier reports
  is now stale.
- **npm's proposed fix for `next` is `next@9.3.3`** — a four-major downgrade,
  presented as a fix. The report labels any semver-major suggestion
  "check this is not a downgrade", because the failure mode here is a maintainer
  running `npm audit fix --force` and quietly reverting the framework.

The report is written to the **job summary**, not only uploaded as an artifact:
an artifact you have to download and unzip is an artifact nobody opens.

Non-blocking, and the report explains why in its own footer rather than leaving
that reasoning in a YAML comment nobody reads.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `audit:report` renders | pass |
| Direct vs transitive split | pass — 1 direct, 2 transitive |
| Job runs non-blocking with a summary + artifact | **verified on the PR run** |

## Away session 3 — Priority 2b · New-login alerts for admins · 2026-07-31

An administrator signing in from a device not seen before now gets an email.
Uses the existing console transport until Resend credentials land — which is the
point: the whole flow is exercised and asserted today, and adding credentials
changes nothing but the transport.

Three deliberate scoping choices:

- **Admins only.** Theirs are the credentials worth stealing — an admin can read
  every provider key's last four, rotate keys, suspend accounts and promote
  users. Alerting every user would be noise for them and cost for us without
  making the admin account safer.
- **New devices only, not every sign-in.** Alerting on every login trains the
  recipient to delete it unread, and then the one that matters looks like the
  ninety before it.
- **The first-ever login does not alert.** There is nothing to compare against,
  so the mail would only say "you signed up".

**What is stored is an HMAC**, never the raw IP or user-agent. A table recording
where an administrator physically signs in from is a worse thing to hold than
the problem it solves, and a genuinely valuable target. Asserted directly: no
stored value contains an address or a browser name.

### The bug the test caught

The first fingerprint implementation kept the browser's **major** version —
which is exactly the digit Chrome changes every four weeks. That would have
alerted every administrator monthly about their own laptop, and an alert that
cries wolf monthly is one nobody reads on the day it matters. All version
numbers are now stripped; what survives is browser family, engine and platform.

### A design forced by a constraint, and better for it

`noteSignIn` decides and records; the **caller** sends. That split was forced —
`server-only` needs the `react-server` condition, React Email needs
`react-dom/server` which that condition removes, so a module importing both
cannot be loaded by a test at all. The result is better regardless: the policy
is testable without a mail transport, which is the part worth testing.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:session` | pass — 41 checks, 16 of them new |
| `security:audit` | pass — 12 tables, `known_logins` deny-all by design |
| Full suite | pass — nothing regressed |
| The email renders correctly in a client | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — blocked on Resend (ISSUE-017) |

## Away session 3 — Priority 4 · Coverage gaps and CONTRIBUTING · 2026-07-31

**One route had no rejection test at all: `/auth/confirm`.** It sits on the
public allow-list because the token in the URL *is* the credential — a session
cannot be required to reach it — and that exemption had quietly meant no
coverage. Public does not mean it accepts anything.

Now asserted: no token, a type without a token, a token without a type, a forged
token and an unknown OTP type all redirect to the login page **and set no
session cookie**. The cookie half matters more than the redirect: a route that
redirects while establishing a session would look correct in a browser.

Plus the open-redirect guard, which is the real risk on a route whose URL
arrives by email — both an absolute and a protocol-relative `next` are proven
unable to send a user off-site.

**The endpoint rate limits are now asserted over HTTP**, not only as unit tests.
`verify:storage` proves the limit module decides correctly; this proves the
route actually calls it, answers 429, and sends a `retry-after` — a limit a
client cannot see the timing of is a limit it will hammer.

`verify:api` is now **80 checks**, up from 65.

**`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — written against how the repo actually works rather than
a template. It leads with the thing that will surprise a contributor (`main`
rejects direct pushes, including the maintainer's), explains why two CI jobs
block and two only report, warns which suites mutate shared state, and states
the house rule that matters: *assert stored state, not response shape*. Every
npm script it names was checked to exist.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Every route has a rejection test | pass — `/auth/confirm` was the last gap |
| `verify:api` | pass — 80/80 |
| Scripts named in CONTRIBUTING exist | pass — checked programmatically |

## Away session 4A — Priority 1 · ISSUE-015 resolved · 2026-07-31

Session 3 left no priority unfinished, so Priority 1 came down to the one
remaining code-resolvable open issue.

**`npm run verify:all`** runs all 17 suites in a deliberate order and proves the
database is as it started. The ordering is the point: credential-free suites
first so a typo fails in two seconds rather than after four minutes, and the two
suites that break shared state (`verify:security`, `verify:admin`) last and
never adjacent to something that reads what they break.

It **refuses to start** if shared state is already dirty — a previous run that
died before its `finally` leaves a provider disabled, and every later run then
builds on that, producing failures that look like new bugs.

**The detector was proved to fail**, not assumed: setting the rate limit to 1
makes the runner refuse and print the remedy. A clean-state check that has never
fired is one you are trusting on faith.

Timings came out of it for free — `verify:session` is 22s of the 81s total,
because it genuinely waits 20 seconds to test refresh-token reuse past the
provider's interval.

The residual risk is unchanged and stated in the issue: serialising removes
interference between suites, not the seconds during which a provider really is
disabled. That fix is a separate Supabase project, which is infrastructure.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:all` | pass — 17 suites, 81.5s, clean before and after |
| Dirt detection demonstrated failing | pass — refuses to start, names the fix |
| Nothing regressed | pass |

## Away session 4A — Priority 2a · Graceful degradation · 2026-07-31

Each external dependency failed in its own dialect: the chat route mapped
`ProviderError` kinds to sentences, the upload routes returned bespoke strings,
email failed silently, and a database outage produced whatever Supabase happened
to say — which is written for the developer who caused it, not the person
reading it.

**`lib/errors/app-error.ts`** gives all four one shape: a `dependency`, a `kind`,
a message *already safe to show a user*, and a `detail` that is logged and never
serialised. Nothing downstream decides whether a given error is safe to render,
because deciding that per call site is how a stack trace eventually reaches a
browser.

Two things it fixes in the chat route:

- **`getAdapter` failures now carry `kind` and `retryable`**, not just a
  sentence. A bare 503 gives the UI nothing to decide a retry button with.
- **Stream failures were unconditionally `retryable: true`.** A mid-stream
  rejection of our API key told the user to try again, and each retry burned
  another request against a key that was never going to work. The flag now comes
  from the failure.

### The bug the test found before I did

`messageFor` fell back to the dependency's `unknown` sentence for any kind it
did not name — and those sentences say "try again shortly" while `unknown` is
deliberately **not** retryable. Eight combinations told a user to retry
something the code would refuse to retry.

Fixed structurally rather than by filling a 40-cell table: fallbacks are now
keyed by **kind**, and each one agrees with the retryable flag by construction.
`unknown` says "This has been logged." because looping on a failure we cannot
classify is how one bad request becomes ten.

**`npm run verify:degradation`** — 185 checks. Exhaustive over every dependency ×
kind: each has a message, each is a complete sentence, none contains a
credential, hostname, path, env var name or stack fragment, and any message
saying "try again" must have the flag to match. Plus normalisation tests that
push genuinely leaky errors through (`/Users/…/.env.local`, a Postgres DSN with
a password, an `sk-ant-` key) and assert the raw text survives only in `detail`.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:degradation` | pass — 185/185, in CI |
| `verify:chat` / `verify:api` | pass — nothing regressed |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |

## Away session 4A — Priority 2b · Retries and timeouts · 2026-07-31

**The rule this is built around:** a stream may only be retried **before its
first token**. Once any text has reached the client, re-running the request
appends a second answer to a partial first one — the model appears to stammer
and the exchange is billed twice. `withRetry` therefore takes an explicit
`hasEmittedOutput` guard rather than trusting a caller to remember, and the test
asserts both directions: the same transient failure is retried before output and
refused after it.

**Timeouts.** Both SDK clients had none, so a hung provider held the request for
the route's full 300s `maxDuration` and the user watched a spinner that never
resolved. Now 90 seconds — comfortably longer than a slow completion, far
shorter than forever. Asserted to be shorter than `maxDuration`, because a
timeout longer than the route is not a timeout.

**The SDKs' own retries are turned off.** Both retry by default with different
counts, different backoff and different opinions about which statuses qualify.
Leaving them on means the effective policy depends on which model the user
picked, and "3 attempts" here would really be 3 × whatever the SDK does.

**Which failures retry is an allow-list**, not "retry unless known-permanent". A
default of retry-unless turns every unclassified failure into three failures,
and the ones we cannot classify are exactly the ones not to multiply. `network`,
`provider` and `rate_limit` retry; `auth`, `quota`, `context_length` and
`unknown` do not. `quota` is excluded despite arriving on a 429-shaped path — an
empty balance does not refill in 400ms.

**Backoff uses full jitter.** Not decoration: without it every client that
failed against one outage retries at the same instant and keeps the provider
down. Asserted over 200 samples that values land in `[0, ceiling]` and are
genuinely spread rather than constant.

An aborted request is never retried — a user pressing Stop must not be answered
with another attempt.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:resilience` | pass — 37 checks, credential-free, in CI |
| `verify:chat` / `verify:providers` / `verify:api` | pass — nothing regressed |
| Retry behaviour under a real provider outage | **NEEDS HUMAN VERIFICATION** — cannot induce one safely |

## Away session 4A — Priority 2c · Structured logging · 2026-07-31

Every route logged in its own voice — `console.error('[api/chat] stream error:',
err)` beside `console.error('[uploads/presign] failed:', err)`. Fine to read one
at a time, impossible to search, and Railway's log view has no idea they are the
same kind of event.

**One shape now**: `requestId`, `route`, `method`, `status`, `outcome`,
`durationMs`, plus optional `userId`, `dependency`, `kind`, `model`, token
counts and `attempts`. One JSON line per request. Server errors go to stderr so
a platform that separates the streams surfaces them without a filter.

### Redaction is structural, not a filter

The obvious design is `log(message, data)` with a scrubber on the way out. That
fails the first time someone interpolates a token into `message`, and it fails
silently. Instead **the payload is a fixed set of typed fields** — there is no
free-form object to hide a secret in, because there is nowhere to put one.
Widening it is a deliberate edit to `LogFields`, which is where a reviewer will
see it. The scrubber still runs, as the second line rather than the first.

Deliberately absent, and asserted absent: `message`, `prompt`, `completion`,
`content`, `email`, `ip`, `body`. A chat app's logs are the one place the entire
private contents of every conversation could accumulate, and "we only log it on
errors" is how that happens — errors are where the interesting text is.

### The test captures real output rather than trusting the function

`npm run verify:logging` — 57 checks. It **replaces `console.log` and
`console.error`**, pushes eleven credential shapes through the real logger
(Anthropic, OpenAI, Supabase secret and publishable, Resend, AWS, a JWT, a
Postgres DSN with a password, an email address, a home path, an encrypted key
blob) and greps what actually came out. A test that checks the redaction
function in isolation proves the function works; this proves the *logger* does.

It also asserts redaction does not eat everything — `connect ETIMEDOUT after
90000ms` survives intact. A log with no information is not safer, just useless.

### A mistake worth recording

My first version of that test asserted **inside** the capture block, so
`check()`'s own output was counted as the logger's and "one line per request"
read as three. The test was wrong, not the logger. Assertions now live outside
the capture.

`verify:all` now covers 20 suites.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:logging` | pass — 57 checks, in CI |
| No ad-hoc `console.*` left in the chat route | pass |
| `verify:all` | pass — 20 suites, clean before and after |

## Away session 4A — Priority 3a · Admin overview · 2026-07-31

`/admin` used to redirect straight to `/admin/providers`. It now has a landing
page: messages today, cost today, cost over 30 days, users, and live provider
health — with a banner naming any provider that is down, because a number that
matters is worse than useless when it needs hunting for.

Three decisions worth recording:

- **Provider health is cached for five minutes.** `validateKey()` performs a
  *real* generation — deliberately, because a key with no credit lists models
  perfectly happily and only fails when asked to write something (ISSUE-012).
  That means every check costs money, so checking on each render would bill the
  account for looking at a page. Cached in module scope rather than a table: it
  resets on deploy and is per-instance, which is acceptable at fractions of a
  cent per check and avoids a migration plus a fourth deny-all table for data
  worthless five minutes after it is written.
- **A provider failure is a result, never a thrown error.** The dashboard's job
  is to report that a provider is down; a page that 500s because a provider is
  down reports nothing.
- **Active users counts distinct users, not usage rows.** One person sending
  forty messages is one active user, and counting rows would make a single heavy
  user look like a busy day.

Counts use `head: true` with an exact count — the number without the rows. The
temptation on a page like this is `select *` and count in JavaScript, which
works beautifully on forty rows and collapses at fifty thousand.

Costs render to four decimals below a cent, because two decimals would show
every figure on this deployment as `$0.00`.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `lint` / `type-check` / `build` | pass |

## Away session 4A — Priority 3b · Per-user usage drill-in · 2026-07-31

`/admin/users/[id]` — spend, tokens, conversations, last active, and a per-model
breakdown over 30 days. Reached from a **Usage** link on each row of the users
list.

Kept as a separate query module rather than extra columns on the list, because
it is a different shape: the list is one row per user with no joins, this is an
aggregation over `usage_logs` for a single id. The "just add a column" instinct
turns one query into N.

Three details:

- **A deleted model still shows its spend**, labelled "Deleted model". Usage rows
  outlive the model row, and dropping them would make the totals disagree with
  the account's actual bill.
- **The row cap is named in the UI when it bites.** Above 50,000 usage rows the
  page says so rather than silently showing a subset — a truncated total that
  looks complete is worse than one that admits it.
- **A non-UUID id 404s before it reaches Postgres**, rather than surfacing a
  driver error.

`verify:authz` picked the new route up on its own (37 → 38 checks) — that is the
suite working as intended, since a route added under an already-gated subtree is
exactly where a missing gate goes unnoticed. It is also now in `verify:api`'s
non-admin refusal list.

## Away session 4A — Priority 3c · Audit log CSV export · 2026-07-31

`GET /api/admin/audit/export?days=90`, with an **Export CSV** button on the audit
page. CSV because the tool at the other end is a spreadsheet — the audit trail
exists to be read by someone who is not looking at this app.

### The part that matters: formula injection

A CSV cell beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` is interpreted by Excel and Google
Sheets as a **formula**. An audit row whose metadata contains
`=HYPERLINK("http://evil","click")` becomes a live link in the reviewer's
spreadsheet.

An audit export is exactly where this bites: the text can be influenced by
whoever performed the audited action, and the reader trusts the file because it
came from their own admin panel. Such cells are prefixed with a quote —
**defused, not destroyed**, so a reviewer still sees what was there. Asserted
against five payloads including the classic DDE one.

Also RFC 4180 proper: quotes doubled, embedded commas and newlines quoted, CRLF
line endings, and `charset=utf-8` because metadata carries non-ASCII and Excel
guesses badly without it.

**The export is itself audited.** That reads as circular and is not: pulling a
complete record of every administrative action is precisely what a later
reviewer wants to see, and an export leaving no trace is a gap in the thing it
is exporting.

Rate limited separately (5/min, 30/hour) — it reads up to 10,000 rows and
resolves every actor's email.

`npm run verify:csv` — 36 checks, credential-free, in CI. It asserts the rules
**and** that the route still applies them, so the escaping and the test cannot
drift apart silently. `verify:all` now covers 21 suites.

| Criterion | Result |

## Away session 4B — Priority 1 · Adversarial review, round 2 · 2026-07-31

Hostile pass over everything merged in sessions 3 and 4A. **Three findings, all
fixed**, plus two bugs my own new tests caught in code written minutes earlier.

### Finding 1 — the health endpoint published outage details

`/api/health` is unauthenticated by necessity (Railway probes it before any
session exists) and echoed Supabase's `error.message` verbatim. The original
comment argued that message describes the failure rather than the credential —
true of the errors you see while everything works, and exactly the wrong thing
to rely on. The messages that appear during a real outage are the ones carrying
a host, a port or a role name, and by then they are already public.

**`verify:degradation` could not catch it**, because the live half only ever ran
against a healthy database — the failure branch was never exercised. It now
reports the classified kind, and the test asserts the classifier over four real
outage shapes plus a source-level check that the raw echo cannot come back.

### Finding 2 — the admin overview could hang for 90 seconds

`validateKey()` inherited the 90-second streaming timeout, and the dashboard
awaits it during a page render. A provider that *hangs* rather than refusing
would block the very page you open to find out a provider is down. Health checks
now have their own 8-second ceiling, and the test asserts it is both shorter
than the streaming timeout and short enough to sit inside a render.

### Finding 3 — tested dead code, which is worse than none

`withRequestLog` was written, exported and covered by 57 checks last session
**without being called anywhere**. The suite reported that request logging
worked while four routes logged nothing at all. Now wired into presign,
download, conversation export and audit export — each reporting its
authenticated user through a mutable context, because the user id is not known
until the handler has authenticated. `x-request-id` is echoed on every response.

The chat route deliberately still logs directly rather than through the wrapper:
it returns a stream that outlives the handler. Asserted, so the difference is a
decision rather than an oversight.

### Two bugs the new tests caught immediately

- **`withDeadline` did not work.** I used `.unref()` on the timer, so it did not
  hold the event loop — and neither does a pending promise — meaning a process
  whose only remaining work was "wait for a deadline on a hung call" exited
  before the timer fired. The test found it by ending mid-run with no summary.
  Fixed by clearing the timer on settle, which gets both properties.
- **`toAppError` matched `timeout` but not `timed out`.** Both SDKs use both
  phrasings, so half of all timeouts classified as `unknown` — which is also the
  half that is *not* retryable. Found because the deadline's own message
  happened to use the other wording.

### Checked and found sound

Rate limits on every route except `/api/health` (deliberate — a liveness probe
gated behind a limit fails its purpose). RLS on all 12 tables, with the three
service-role-only tables deny-all by design. Every new endpoint gated, detected
automatically by `verify:authz`. No drift from the CLAUDE.md security rules.

**Logged, not fixed:** the audit export resolves actor emails via
`listUsers({ perPage: 1000 })`. Beyond 1,000 users some rows would export with a
blank email rather than a wrong one. Correct behaviour, incomplete data — noted
rather than paged over, since this deployment has single digits of users.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:degradation` | pass — 194, up from 185 |
| `verify:resilience` | pass — 47, up from 37 |
| `verify:logging` | pass — 69, up from 57 |
| `verify:all` | pass — 21 suites, clean before and after |

## Away session 4B — Priority 2a · Analytics query plans · 2026-07-31

### The honest problem with profiling this deployment

There are **178 messages and 266 usage rows**. Every analytics query runs in
under 1.2ms, and Postgres correctly sequential-scans tables that fit in two
pages. **EXPLAIN against real data here cannot distinguish a good index strategy
from a bad one** — claiming an index "improved" anything on that evidence would
be fabrication.

So the decision was made at a volume where the answer is not obvious:
`benchmark_message_index()` builds a **temp table** of 200,000 synthetic rows,
runs the dashboard's own count query with and without the candidate index, and
returns both plans. Temp tables are per-session and vanish on disconnect, so it
touches no real data.

| | Execution time |
| --- | --- |
| before: no index | **106.8 ms** |
| after: partial index on `(created_at) where role = 'user'` | **23.5 ms** |

A 4.5× improvement, measured rather than assumed.

### What was actually missing

`messages` had indexes on `(conversation_id, created_at)` and
`(conversation_id, seq)` — both excellent for reading one thread, and **useless
for a query with no `conversation_id`**. The dashboard counts user messages
globally by date, twice.

The index is **partial on `role = 'user'`** because every caller filters on it.
Indexing the assistant half would roughly double the write cost — and messages
are written on the hot path of every chat turn — to speed up queries nobody runs.

On the real table the planner cost for that query fell from **13.61 to 5.71**.
Actual runtime is unchanged at 0.05ms, because 178 rows is nothing either way.
That is stated rather than dressed up.

### Everything else was already covered

`usage_logs` has `created_at` and `(user_id, created_at)`, which cover the
analytics range scan and the per-user drill-in. `audit_logs` has `created_at`
and `action`. No further indexes were added, because no further access pattern
lacked one.

### The tooling is now permanent

`explain_analytics()` returns plans for the seven real aggregations, and
`verify:schema` asserts against them — **on planner cost, not runtime**. A
timing assertion at 178 rows would pass whether or not the index existed, which
is the definition of a useless test. Cost is what the planner computes from the
index's existence, so it is what actually changes.

Both functions take **no SQL parameter**. A flexible `explain(sql text)` would
be more convenient and is a general-purpose SQL executor wearing a hat —
PostgREST otherwise exposes only CRUD, so it would add capability that does not
currently exist, for a profiling task.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Before/after measured at realistic volume | 106.8ms → 23.5ms |
| `verify:schema` | pass — index coverage asserted on cost |
| `verify:all` | pass — 21 suites |
| `security:audit` | pass — 12 tables, RLS intact |

## Away session 4B — Priority 2b · Chat route pre-flight latency · 2026-07-31

**Measured before changing anything.** A new `prepMs` field records the time
from request start to the moment the provider call begins — everything above
that line is ours, everything below is the model's. It is kept separate from
`durationMs` on purpose: total duration is dominated by how long the model takes
to write, which is not ours to fix, and without the split "the app feels slow"
is unattributable.

| | Median `prepMs` |
| --- | --- |
| before | **590 ms** (n=3, 578–647) |
| after | **504 ms** (n=15, 453–590) |

**86 ms, about 15%.** The first sample of each run is discarded — it is a cold
start, and comparing a cold sample to a warm one would flatter whichever ran
second. These are dev-server numbers against a remote database, so they are
noisy; the direction is solid, the precise figure is not.

### What changed

Four pre-flight checks — conversation ownership, suspension, hourly rate limit,
daily token budget — were four sequential network round trips to Supabase. None
depends on another: ownership needs the conversation id, the other three need
only the user id. They are now issued together.

**The results are still evaluated in the original order**, and that is not
cosmetic: a foreign conversation must 404 *before* a rate limit can 429, or the
refusal itself tells the caller that someone else's conversation exists. There
is now a test asserting the order of those four branches in the source, alongside
the existing contract test proving a foreign conversation is byte-identical to a
missing one.

The cost of issuing them together is doing a little work for requests that were
going to be refused anyway. Four cheap indexed reads is a good trade for 86ms on
every accepted one.

### Also: the success path logged nothing

Only failures produced a log line, so the only observable requests were the
broken ones — which makes every latency question unanswerable. One line per
completed turn now, carrying `prepMs`, token counts and the model.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Before/after measured, cold samples excluded | 590ms → 504ms |
| Refusal ordering preserved | pass — asserted in source and over HTTP |
| `verify:all` | pass — 21 suites |

## Away session 4B — Priority 2c · Bundle · 2026-07-31

**The premise did not hold, and that is the finding.** The task expected admin
charts to be a lazy-loading win. Measured against the real build:

| Page | Client JS | Heavy libraries present |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/login` | 746 KB | none |
| `/profile` | 752 KB | none |
| `/settings` | 761 KB | none |
| `/` (chat) | 1211 KB | react-markdown + syntax highlighting |

Recharts is **already route-scoped** by Next — grepping the chunks `/login`
actually loads finds no trace of it, nor of framer-motion, lucide or markdown.
Lucide is **already tree-shaken**. There was nothing to move.

### The one real candidate, deliberately not taken

The chat route carries ~450KB of markdown and highlighting that its **empty
state** does not need. Lazy-loading it was rejected: a conversation page with
existing messages needs it immediately, so deferring risks a visible flash on
exactly the page that matters most. That is a visual change, on a screen no
check here can inspect, and the brief said no visual changes.

Manufacturing a change to have something to show would have been the wrong
instinct. The measurement is the deliverable.

### What was built instead

`npm run verify:bundle` — 7 checks that lock in the state that measured well:

- **Heavy libraries stay in one component each.** Route splitting only holds
  while `recharts` lives solely in `analytics-client.tsx` and `react-markdown`
  solely in `markdown.tsx`. The day someone imports a chart into a shared
  component, every page pays 384KB — and nothing would fail. Now it does.
- **Total client JS under 3MB, no chunk over 600KB.** A ceiling with headroom,
  to catch a step change rather than police ordinary growth.
- **No namespace import of lucide-react**, which would defeat tree-shaking and
  pull ~1,500 icons.

Runs in the `quality` job after the build, since it reads build output.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Measured per-page JS against a real build | done — table above |
| `verify:bundle` | pass — 7 checks, in CI |
| Lazy-loading applied | **no** — no win available without a visual change |

## Away session 4B — Priority 3 · Showcase polish · 2026-07-31

**Figures refreshed everywhere** — they were a session and a half stale.
SHOWCASE.md and the LinkedIn drafts now say 20,097 lines across 139 files, 23
suites, ~900 assertions, 16 migrations, 70 commits, 30 pull requests. Each was
re-counted rather than incremented, and the drafts now carry the two commands
that re-check them, because the figures will drift again.

SHOWCASE's "found by looking, not by testing" section gained the three newest
ones: the health endpoint publishing outage details, a wrapper tested for a
whole session without being called, and a timeout helper that did not time out.

**`docs/wiki/DEMO-SCRIPT.md`** — a three-minute click path with what to click,
what to say, and in what order. Written for someone who watches 40 seconds and
decides whether to keep watching, so the multi-provider claim is visible before
the first minute is out.

The pre-record checklist matters as much as the script: sign in first, pick a
non-default theme, and **do not open the paperclip** — file storage is not
configured, the button is correctly disabled, and lingering on it invites the
one question that cannot be answered well. There is also a "things not to say"
section, of which the important line is *do not say production-ready without
saying what is not ready*.

**README** now opens with the honest state — live and working, Phase 6 waiting
on credentials, two known-open items named — and adds a "where to start reading"
table, because a first-time visitor was previously dropped straight into
requirements. Every relative link in the docs was checked to resolve; the only
misses are the screenshot placeholders, which are placeholders on purpose.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Figures re-counted, not estimated | done |
| `DEMO-SCRIPT.md` | written — 3 minutes, six beats |
| Every relative doc link resolves | pass |
| `lint` / `build` | pass |

## Away session 4B — Priority 4 · Coverage and dead code · 2026-07-31

**Every route already has a negative-path test.** All seven — chat, health,
presign, download, both exports and `/auth/confirm` — are probed by
`verify:api`. Nothing to add; the gap was closed in 4A and the newest route
(audit export) came with its tests.

### Dead code sweep — reported before removing

**Every dependency is referenced.** No unused packages.

**Exactly one export is provably dead:** `Pressable` in
`components/motion/motion.tsx`, written in session 2 and never called anywhere.
Removed — 22 lines.

Four categories were flagged by the crude scan and are **not** dead, which is
why the sweep reported before deleting:

| Flagged | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `updateSession` | Used by `proxy.ts`, which sits at the repo root and was outside the scanned directories. A false positive that a less careful sweep would have deleted, taking session refresh with it. |
| `sendWelcomeEmail`, `sendPasswordResetEmail`, `sendMagicLinkEmail`, `sendAdminAlertEmail` | Built ahead of credentials for Phase 6 (ISSUE-017). Unused *yet*, not dead — deleting them would throw away finished work that is waiting on an account. |
| `getProviderHealth` | Called in its own file. The export exists so a future refresh control can force a re-check; harmless, and left. |
| Exported types (`UserUsage`, `RetryOutcome`, `PaletteModel`, …) | API surface. A type used only as an annotation reads as unreferenced to a grep. |

The lesson is in the first row: an automated dead-code sweep would have deleted
`updateSession` and broken session refresh on every request. "Provably
unreferenced" has to mean *verified*, not *not found by one grep*.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Routes without a negative-path test | none |
| Unused dependencies | none |
| Dead exports removed | 1 (`Pressable`) |
| `verify:all` | pass — 22 suites |

## ISSUE-028 resolved — and the original finding was my test's fault · 2026-07-31

The owner enabled *Detect and revoke potentially compromised refresh tokens*
with a 10s reuse interval. Verifying it produced a more interesting answer than
expected.

**The original High-severity claim was wrong.** `supabase-js`'s
`refreshSession()` resolves successfully for a token whose successor already
exists — returning that successor — while the auth endpoint answers `400`. My
test read "the promise resolved" as "the token was accepted" and reported a hole
on that basis. The SDK was being helpful; the test was not.

**Measured against `POST /auth/v1/token` directly**, the realistic threat model:

```
attacker copies the token at sign-in
  victim rotation 1 (t+12s)
  victim rotation 2 (t+24s)
  victim rotation 3 (t+36s)

attacker replays the stolen token, 36s and 3 rotations later:
  HTTP 400  REJECTED: Invalid Refresh Token: Already Used
  victim's current token: HTTP 200 (unaffected)
```

The stolen token is **refused**. Exposure is bounded by the victim's next
rotation, not open-ended. Severity **High → Low**.

**Residual gap, real but small:** reuse is refused, not *detected*. The family
is not revoked, the victim is not signed out, nothing is recorded — so a theft
is stopped and leaves no trace. Family revocation was never observed firing
across four probes.

**Stopped investigating deliberately.** Four probes gave inconsistent
intermediate results — a replay was accepted in some orderings and refused in
others — and pinning down the exact internal rule is Supabase's business, not
this repository's. What matters here is measured and stable.

`verify:session` now asserts the threat model against the raw endpoint, and
*warns* about the missing revocation rather than failing: a check demanding
behaviour nobody can produce stays red for ever. `-- --strict` promotes it.

The stale claim was also corrected in SHOWCASE.md and in the 4B report, rather
than left to read as current.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Stolen token refused after rotation | pass — HTTP 400, "Already Used" |
| Sign-out invalidates | pass |
| Family revocation on reuse | **not observed** — warned, not asserted |
| `verify:all` | pass — 22 suites |

## Working session — Riso as the default look · 2026-08-01

Three merged PRs: [#36](https://github.com/MyChat99/myaichat/pull/36),
[#37](https://github.com/MyChat99/myaichat/pull/37), #38.

### The theme

Mockup option 5 (`docs/mockups/05-riso.html`) is now a real preset and the
default for anyone who has not chosen one — new accounts and every signed-out
page. Printed matter rather than emitted light: paper stock with a green
undertone, two genuine Riso stock inks, and hard black keylines where every
other preset has a soft grey border. That border token (`#1d2230` in light) is
the one value that looks like a mistake in a table and is not — the 2px rules
are the whole identity.

Three ink colours were darkened to clear AA, each along its own hue rather than
toward neutral, so the character survives:

| token | mockup | shipped | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `textMuted` | `#7a8094` | `#606575` | 3.38:1 | 4.56:1 |
| `destructive` | `#ff48b0` | `#bd3582` | 2.65:1 | 4.52:1 |
| `success` | `#00a95c` | `#00753f` | 3.32:1 | 4.62:1 |

Each was found by darkening in 1% steps until AA passed, so the delta is the
minimum rather than a guess. Dark mode needed no adjustment: there the
fluorescent pink is the accent and glows against near-black, which is the one
thing that ink does on a screen and cannot do on paper.

**Existing preferences were not touched.** Both migrations move a column
`DEFAULT`, which applies to rows inserted afterwards and never to rows already
there. Confirmed against the live database after each: the one stored
preference is still `default/blue`.

### The bug the second PR found

PR #36 claimed Riso was the default look. It was two-thirds true. The default
accent was the named preset `blue`, which resolves to `#1d4ed8` and is written
into `--primary` in **both** modes — so the shipped default was Riso's paper
with a generic Tailwind blue painted over it, and Federal Blue and the fluoro
pink never appeared for anyone who had not been into settings.

The fix is a sentinel accent, `'theme'`, meaning *follow the preset's own
per-mode ink*. `withAccent(tokens, null)` already returned theme tokens
untouched, and the existing column CHECK admits a lowercase word, so it is a
default-value change rather than a mechanism or constraint change. `/login` now
serves `--primary:#3d5588` in light and `--primary:#ff48b0` in dark.

It was only caught because the check got strict enough to catch it. The old
signed-out assertion was `includes('id="theme-tokens"')` — which a page that
emits tokens and then swaps them on hydration passes while still flashing.

### What is now checked

`verify:appearance` grew 20 → 30. For a signed-out visitor on `/login`, from the
served bytes alone: 200; default theme and mode resolved in the markup; **both**
modes' tokens in the same document (system mode means ~half of first-time
visitors need dark, and a missing dark block *is* the flash); token block and
pre-paint script both in `<head>`, in that order; no hardcoded `dark` class
under system; and `--primary` is the theme's own ink in each block. Every column
default is compared against `DEFAULT_APPEARANCE`, not just `preset_theme`.

`verify:theme` is at 152 contrast checks (was 134) — all 18 new Riso pairings
pass, muted text included.

Two test bugs fixed while writing this: the script-position check anchored on
`prefers-color-scheme`, which matches Next's own injected stylesheet ~1800 bytes
earlier and so measured somebody else's CSS; and the defaults check named
`'default'` as a literal, which would have passed while the database and the
application disagreed.

### ISSUES sweep

- **ISSUE-005** (hand-maintained types) — the `--db-url` workaround that fixed
  `db push` does **not** fix `gen types`: it connects and then still demands a
  container. Ruled out, recorded, do not retry without Docker. Instead the
  named gap is closed: `verify:schema` now compares every column of every table
  and view against PostgREST's own OpenAPI document — live-derived, no
  container, no new migration. Both drift directions reported separately, and
  proven to fail in both before commit. 87 columns across 10 relations match.
  Severity Medium → Low. Column *types* remain unchecked.
- **ISSUE-006** — re-measured: 12 high-severity advisories are now **3**, all
  `sharp`/libvips. The ESLint-chain and `postcss` ones cleared upstream exactly
  as predicted, with no action taken here.

### Not touched, deliberately

Every Phase 6 human check in the pause block above. None has been performed and
none is marked done. Phase 6 remains **not Done**, and production still lacks
the R2 and Resend variables.

### What needs your eyes

Contrast is arithmetic and it passes; whether Riso *looks* right is not
something a headless check can answer. Worth seeing both modes, the picker in
`/settings`, and the two new controls there — a two-tone "match theme" accent
swatch and a "Reset to default" button.

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `verify:theme` | pass — 152 contrast checks |
| `verify:appearance` | pass — 30 checks |
| `verify:schema` | pass — including 87-column parity |
| `verify:all` | pass — 22 suites, 93s, clean before and after |
| lint / type-check / build | pass |
