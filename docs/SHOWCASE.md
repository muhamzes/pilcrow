# myaichat — a walkthrough

For a technical reader who wants to know what was built, how it holds together,
and what state it is actually in. No hype, and the unfinished parts are named.

## What it is

A multi-provider AI chat platform. You bring your own keys for any of four
providers — Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq and Perplexity;
it gives you streaming chat, an admin panel to manage providers and models,
per-user theming, usage analytics and an audit trail.

It also has a look. The default theme, **Riso**, is a risograph print rather
than a white page: newsprint stock with a green undertone, Federal Blue and
Fluorescent Pink as the two inks, and hard black keylines where the rest of the
industry puts a soft grey border. It is not a palette — it restyles the sidebar
into bordered slips under mono section rules, the empty state into an editorial
spread with numbered picks, and the composer into a boxed COMPOSE panel. A test
parses the stylesheet and fails the build if any rule is not scoped to the
theme, which is how seven other presets stay untouched by it. Seven other presets are a click away, and
every one of them — all 152 foreground/background pairings — is checked against
WCAG AA from the token data, so adding a theme gets it checked without anyone
writing a new test.

The interesting constraint is that **it is not tied to a provider**. Adding a
fourth meant writing one adapter file and one registry line — no route change, no
UI change, no schema change. That claim is enforced by a test that greps the
tree and fails if a vendor SDK import or a provider name appears outside
`lib/providers`.

## Architecture

Full diagrams in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). The three parts worth
knowing:

### The provider abstraction

`app/api/chat/route.ts` names no vendor and imports no vendor SDK. It asks the
registry for the conversation's model, gets back a `ChatProvider`, and streams
whatever comes out.

Adapters are **factories that take an API key**, not singletons. That is not
stylistic: keys are decrypted per request, so an adapter holding one at module
load would keep serving a key that had since been rotated in the admin panel.

```
/api/chat  →  registry  →  decrypt key  →  adapter(key)  →  vendor SDK
   ↑ no vendor names        ↑ AES-256-GCM    ↑ one request's lifetime
```

### The four authorisation layers

Each assumes the one before it can be bypassed:

1. **`proxy.ts`** — coarse redirect. Explicitly *not* the boundary; API routes
   are exempted from its redirect entirely, because a `fetch` expecting JSON
   that silently follows a 307 into an HTML login page reports success.
2. **`requireUser()` / `requireAdmin()`** — in every page and action. A test
   reads the source and fails if a new one is added without a gate.
3. **RLS** — on all 12 tables, three of them deny-all and reachable only by the
   service role. A bug that reached the database with the wrong user id still
   cannot read another user's rows.
4. **`SECURITY DEFINER` helpers** — because a policy *on* `profiles` that
   queries `profiles` recurses infinitely. That bug blocked every profile edit
   and **passed its first test**, because a blocked update and a crashed update
   both return zero rows.

High-value actions add a fifth: writing a provider key, deleting a model or
changing a role re-verifies the password server-side, on a throwaway client, and
is throttled so the field is not a password oracle.

### Secrets

Provider keys are AES-256-GCM at rest, format `v1.<iv>.<tag>.<ciphertext>`. The
version prefix exists so an algorithm change can read both formats and
re-encrypt on write rather than needing a flag day. GCM is authenticated, so a
tampered value throws instead of decrypting to garbage.

The master key lives only in the environment. Every module on the decryption
path imports `server-only`, so an accidental client import fails the build
rather than leaking.

---

## The verification story

**There is no test framework and no test suite** — this is a verification
harness: 39 hand-written `verify:*` scripts, each exercising the real database,
the real running server, or the real source. That is a deliberate choice, and the
reason is empirical: the bugs this project actually hit were not the kind a mocked
unit test catches. It is worth saying plainly that a harness is not a substitute
for a suite — there is no coverage measurement, and CI runs only the 11
credential-free scripts.

The rule the harness is built on: **assert stored state, not response shape.**

Three examples of why:

**A blocked write and a crashed write look identical.** The RLS recursion bug
returned zero rows either way. The test that "passed" was reading the response;
the fix was to read the value back with a different client.

**A 200 can be a failure.** An unauthenticated `POST /api/chat` once returned
200 with an HTML login page, because the proxy redirected it and `fetch`
followed. Tests now assert status *and* content type.

**A test can be true and useless.** The chat route sent the model the **oldest**
40 messages instead of the newest — `ORDER BY created_at ASC LIMIT 40`. Nothing
errored; the assistant just seemed to lose the thread on long conversations. A
test asserting "40 rows returned" passes the broken version. The test now
asserts the window *ends with the newest message and excludes the oldest*.

| Suite | Asserts | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `verify:degradation` | 194 — every dependency fails clearly and leaks nothing | — |
| `verify:theme` | 152 — WCAG AA contrast, every theme, both modes | — |
| `verify:riso` | 29 — every Riso rule is scoped; its own colours meet AA | — |
| `verify:api` | 84 — every route rejects bad input and other users | server |
| `verify:logging` | 67 — one log shape, no secrets, proven by capture | — |
| `verify:resilience` | 50 — retry policy, backoff, outbound timeouts | — |
| `verify:security` | 42 — throttling, password rules, rate limits, budgets | database |
| `verify:session` | 41 — idle policy, refresh-token behaviour | database |
| `verify:authz` | 39 — no action or route shipped without a gate | — |
| `verify:attachments` | 33 — every upload rejection path | — |
| `verify:headers` | 25 — header and CSP configuration, both modes | — |
| `verify:csv` | 36 — CSV escaping and formula injection | — |
| `verify:bundle` | 7 — heavy libraries stay confined | build |
| plus 11 more | schema, rls, seed, storage, gates, appearance, chat, providers, admin, email, smoke | |

`npm run verify:all` runs all 23 in a safe order and proves the database is as
it started — refusing to begin if a previous run left it dirty.

Two are worth singling out:

- **`verify:providers`** greps the tree. Two providers both streaming would pass
  a behavioural test with an `if/else` in the route; this fails it.
- **`verify:admin`** breaks **only the database key** and asserts chat then
  fails — proving there is no silent fallback to an environment variable.

## Things that were found by looking, not by testing

The honest part. These are bugs that shipped and were caught later, and what
each one changed.

**The model was sent the oldest messages, not the newest.** Past 40 turns it
never saw the question just asked. No error, no bad status — it reads as a model
limitation. Found by reading the query during an adversarial review.

**A stolen refresh token — and then my own test was the bug.** I wrote a test
that simulated the theft rather than asserting the assumption, and it reported
that a replayed token stayed valid indefinitely. It did not. `supabase-js`
resolves successfully for a token whose successor exists, returning that
successor, where the auth endpoint answers 400 — so "the promise resolved" is
not "the token was accepted". Re-measured against the endpoint directly, a
stolen token is refused as soon as the victim rotates past it. I had reported a
High-severity hole on the strength of a helpful SDK.

The residual finding is smaller and real: reuse is *refused* but not *detected*,
so a theft is stopped and leaves no trace.

**Upload endpoints were rate-limited by counting their own audit rows.** That
coupled a permanent record to a rolling window — pruning one damaged the other.
Downloads had no limit at all, because nothing audited them.

**A "new device" alert would have fired monthly for everyone.** The first
fingerprint kept the browser's major version, which is exactly the digit Chrome
changes every four weeks. Caught by a test asserting a version bump is the same
device.

**CI was red on `main` for forty minutes and I did not notice**, because the
next commit fixed the formatting before I looked. That one is now structurally
impossible — branch protection requires the checks to pass on the exact commit.

**The health endpoint published outage details.** Unauthenticated by necessity,
it echoed the database's own error message — fine for the errors you see while
everything works, and exactly wrong for the ones that appear during an outage,
which carry a host and a role name. The test could not catch it because it only
ever ran against a healthy database.

**A wrapper was tested for a whole session without being called anywhere.**
57 checks reported that request logging worked while four routes logged nothing
at all. Tested dead code is worse than none.

**A timeout helper did not time out.** `.unref()` on the timer meant it did not
hold the event loop — and neither does a pending promise — so the process exited
before the deadline fired. Its own test caught it by ending mid-run.

**The navigation was unreachable on a phone, past 1,176 passing assertions.**
At 360px, *Presses, Profile, Appearance, Admin and Sign out* were all beyond the
right edge — not scrolled off, clipped and gone, because the chat pane clips
with `overflow: hidden`. There was no scrollbar to hint they existed; you could
not open settings or sign out from a phone at all. Every suite in this repo
asserted rows, bytes or source text. **None of them had ever opened a page.**

That is the finding behind `verify:pages`, and the suite's first three attempts
at a check were themselves wrong — each proven so by breaking the app on
purpose:

- The obvious overflow test **never fires here.** A deliberately 2200px-wide
  element left the document at exactly 360px, because the shell clips. Measuring
  `<html>` was a green light on a broken page.
- An 18px switch **is a 34px target** — the component pushes its hit area out
  with a pseudo-element, so the element's own box condemns a control that is
  fine.
- WCAG exempts a target inside a sentence. An approximation of that rule
  ("the parent is 12 characters longer") called *"No account? Create one"* a
  standalone control, by one character.

**`role="status"` is not an error channel.** The failure-path suite asked "did
the app say anything when the budget ran out" and got back *"Loading
conversation…"* — a progress announcement, counted as an answer. It passed the
"it said something" check and failed the one that read what was said.

## Phase history

Built in eight phases, each with its own acceptance criteria. `Done` means
built; `Verified` means every criterion proved.

| # | Phase | State | Key commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Foundation — scaffold, auth, schema, RLS | Verified | `063cb7c` |
| 2 | Streaming chat, persistence, message actions | Verified | `118fa3c` |
| 3 | Provider abstraction, second provider, model selector | Verified | `37fa660` |
| 4 | Admin panel, encrypted keys, audit logging | Verified | `46d112e` |
| 5 | Theming — 8 presets, Riso default, zero-flash SSR | Done | `f52e633` |
| 6 | R2 uploads, attachments, Resend templates | **Blocked** — needs credentials | `09eebd4` |
| 7 | Analytics, audit UI, motion, command palette | Partial | `6c67cc5` |
| 8 | CI/CD, branch protection, health check | Done | `f99674e` |

## What is not finished

- **Phase 6 needs credentials.** Every rejection path is built and tested; the
  only untestable step is the PUT to the bucket. [The checklist](wiki/PHASE-6-CHECKLIST.md)
  is written and needs no code change.
- **Refresh-token reuse detection is off** — a Supabase dashboard setting, filed
  as ISSUE-028 with the exact toggle.
- **Phase 7's performance and accessibility passes** need a browser and
  Lighthouse; they are not measurable headlessly and are not claimed.
- **CI and the Railway deploy are not chained.** Every deploy comes from a
  CI-green commit because merges require it, but the deploy is not itself gated.
  Written up with tradeoffs and a recommendation of *not yet*.

## If you only read one file

[`lib/providers/README.md`](../lib/providers/README.md) — adding a provider in
five steps, and the vendor differences the abstraction absorbs. That table is
the clearest statement of what this codebase is for:

| | Anthropic | OpenAI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System prompt | separate field | first message |
| Output cap | `max_tokens` | `max_completion_tokens` |
| Usage while streaming | on the final message | only with `stream_options` |
| Out of credit | 4xx with a billing message | 429 with `insufficient_quota` |
| `max_tokens: 1` | truncates | **errors** |

That last row is why `validateKey()` performs a real generation instead of
listing models: an unfunded key lists models perfectly happily and fails only
when you ask it to write something.
