# Architecture

How myaichat is put together, and — more usefully — why the non-obvious parts
are the way they are. Anything here that reads as a strange choice has a reason
recorded next to it or in [wiki/DECISIONS.md](wiki/DECISIONS.md).

Three things about this drawing are load-bearing:

**Only `lib/providers` touches a vendor SDK.** The chat route asks the registry
for an adapter and streams whatever comes back; it names no vendor and imports
no vendor package. `npm run verify:providers` greps the tree to prove it, because
providers all working is not evidence — an `if/else` in the route would pass that
test and fail this one.

Four are registered: Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq and Perplexity. The last two speak
OpenAI's wire format at a different base URL, so they share
`openai-compatible.ts` rather than re-implementing the same stream parsing three
times — and the parts of "OpenAI-compatible" that are not (the output-cap
parameter's name, whether `stream_options` is accepted, whether `GET /models`
exists) are the config that file exposes. `npm run verify:adapters` exercises
every rejection path against a local fake, so 401 / 429 / quota / context-length
handling is tested without a credential and without spending anything.

**Mutations are Server Actions, not route handlers.** Next verifies the `Origin`
header before a Server Action body runs, which is the CSRF control. A mutation
exposed as a plain `POST` route would need that written by hand, so none are.

**`proxy.ts` is a convenience, not a boundary.** It refreshes the session cookie
and redirects anonymous visitors early. Every page and action re-checks
server-side anyway — see [the four layers](#the-four-authorisation-layers).

---

## Request paths

### A chat message

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Browser
    participant R as /api/chat
    participant S as lib/security
    participant G as registry
    participant P as Provider API
    participant D as Postgres

    U->>R: POST {conversationId, message}
    R->>D: getUser() + conversation via RLS
    D-->>R: row, or nothing (404 — not "forbidden")
    R->>S: suspended? rate limit? token budget?
    S->>D: counts since the window / UTC midnight
    alt any gate refuses
        R-->>U: 403 or 429 (JSON, never a redirect)
    else allowed
        R->>D: insert user message
        R->>G: adapter for this conversation's model
        G->>D: decrypt provider key (DB first, env fallback)
        G->>P: stream request
        loop each chunk
            P-->>R: delta
            R-->>U: {"type":"text",...}\n
        end
        R->>D: insert assistant message + usage_logs row
        R-->>U: {"type":"done","messageId":...}\n
    end
```

**Wire format is NDJSON, not SSE.** The request has to be a POST — the body
carries the conversation and message — and `EventSource` cannot POST. NDJSON is
two lines to parse from a `fetch` reader.

**A conversation belonging to someone else 404s rather than 403s.** The query
runs through the user's own client, so RLS returns no row; there is nothing to
distinguish "not yours" from "does not exist", which is the intent.

**Ordering matters.** The user's message is written *before* the provider is
called, so an interrupted stream leaves a question with no answer rather than
losing the question. The `usage_logs` row is written after completion, which is
why the daily budget is a ceiling rather than an exact meter — see
`lib/security/token-budget.ts`.

### A comparison

`/api/compare` is the one route that exists because of the abstraction rather
than in spite of it: one prompt, up to four vendors, at once.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Browser
    participant R as /api/compare
    participant S as lib/security
    participant G as registry
    participant P as Provider APIs
    participant D as Postgres

    U->>R: POST {prompt, modelIds[2..4]}
    R->>R: deduplicate ids, then count them
    R->>S: suspended? rate limit? budget already spent?
    R->>D: resolve every id against the offered catalogue
    alt any id is unknown or unavailable
        R-->>U: 409 — reload and pick again
    else worst case would cross the daily budget
        R-->>U: 429, naming how much room is left
    else allowed
        par one per model, independently
            R->>G: adapter for this model
            G->>P: stream request
            P-->>R: deltas
            R-->>U: {"type":"text","modelId":...}\n
            R->>D: usage_logs row for this model
            R-->>U: {"type":"model_done","modelId":...,"costUsd":...}\n
        end
    end
```

**It is a separate route, not a mode on `/api/chat`.** A conversation owns
history, titles, truncation and a stored message; a comparison is one turn and
several answers kept only long enough to read. Adding a flag would put a branch
through all of that machinery for a request that uses none of it.

**It refuses before spending, not partway through.** The ordinary budget check
asks whether the user has *already* exceeded the limit. That is the wrong
question for a request that commits N turns at once, so this route also refuses
when `models.length × MAX_TOKENS` would cross the line. A comparison that starts
inside the budget and ends outside it is precisely the failure a spend ceiling
exists to prevent.

**Ids are deduplicated before they are counted.** `[a, a]` used to pass the
two-model minimum and bill twice for one answer.

**One vendor failing costs the user only that column.** Each model settles on
its own; a rejection is a `model_error` event on that column, not a failure of
the request.

### What an answer cost

`usage_logs.message_id` links a usage row to the answer it paid for. Three
deliberate choices, all in [DEC-022](wiki/DECISIONS.md#dec-022):

- **`on delete set null`, not `cascade`** — deleting a conversation must not
  erase what it cost. Billing history a user can delete is not billing history.
- **No backfill** — rows written before the link exist, and correlating them to
  answers by timestamp would be right most of the time and silently wrong the
  rest. An answer that cannot be priced shows no price, never `$0.00`.
- **The stored cost is read, never recomputed** — a rate change must not
  retroactively rewrite what last month's answers cost.

`usage_logs` is one of the three service-role-only tables, so `loadConversationCost`
runs on a client that bypasses RLS and scopes every query to an already
authenticated user id. **That scope is the entire authorization boundary for the
feature**, which is why `verify:costs` asserts it directly and was run with the
scope removed to prove the assertion is not vacuous.

### Signing in

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Browser
    participant A as signIn action
    participant T as throttle
    participant SB as Supabase Auth
    participant D as auth_attempts

    U->>A: email + password
    A->>T: checkThrottle(email, ip)
    T->>D: failures in the last 15 min
    alt 5+ for this account, or 30+ for this IP
        T-->>A: blocked
        A-->>U: "try again in N minutes"
    else allowed
        A->>SB: signInWithPassword
        SB-->>A: session, or error
        A->>D: record attempt (success clears the account's rows)
        A-->>U: redirect, or one generic error
    end
```

The error is deliberately identical for "no such account" and "wrong password".
Distinguishing them tells an attacker which addresses are registered.

## Data model

```mermaid
erDiagram
    auth_users ||--|| profiles : "trigger on signup"
    auth_users ||--o| user_preferences : has
    auth_users ||--o{ conversations : owns
    auth_users ||--o{ usage_logs : generates
    auth_users ||--o{ audit_logs : "acts in"
    conversations ||--o{ messages : contains
    providers ||--o{ models : offers
    models ||--o{ conversations : "selected for"
    models ||--o{ usage_logs : "billed to"

    providers {
        text name PK_unique
        text encrypted_api_key "AES-256-GCM, never leaves the server"
        text key_last4 "display only"
        boolean enabled
    }
    models {
        uuid provider_id FK
        text model_id "the vendor's string"
        numeric input_cost_per_1k
        boolean enabled
    }
    profiles {
        uuid id PK "= auth.users.id"
        user_role role "'user' | 'admin'"
        boolean suspended
    }
    system_settings {
        text key PK
        jsonb value "NOT NULL — see ISSUE-008"
    }
    auth_attempts {
        text identifier "HMAC of email or IP, never raw"
        text kind "'login' | 'reauth'"
    }
```

Two notes:

**`providers.encrypted_api_key` is not protected by RLS**, because RLS is
row-level and cannot hide a column. `SELECT` on `providers` is revoked from
`authenticated` entirely, and a `providers_public` view exposes the safe columns.
The encrypted key is reachable only through the service-role client.

**`system_settings.value` is `jsonb NOT NULL`.** A JavaScript `null` becomes SQL
`NULL` and violates that constraint — which is how the seed script crashed on
day one (ISSUE-008). Settings with no value are omitted, not written as null.

---

## The four authorisation layers

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["1 · proxy.ts<br/>redirect anonymous"] --> B["2 · requireUser / requireAdmin<br/>in every page + action"]
    B --> C["3 · RLS policies<br/>enforced by Postgres"]
    C --> D["4 · SECURITY DEFINER helpers<br/>is_admin() · is_suspended()"]
```

Each layer assumes the ones before it may be bypassed:

1. **`proxy.ts`** — coarse and fast. Never the boundary; API routes are exempted
   from its redirect entirely, because a `fetch` expecting JSON that silently
   follows a 307 into an HTML login page reports success (ISSUE-011).
2. **`requireUser()` / `requireAdmin()`** — in every page and every Server
   Action. `npm run verify:authz` reads the source to prove none was forgotten.
3. **RLS** — on all ten public tables. Even a bug that reached the database with
   the wrong user's id cannot read another user's rows.
4. **`SECURITY DEFINER` helpers** — `is_admin()` and `is_suspended()` exist
   because a policy *on* `profiles` that queries `profiles` recurses infinitely.
   That bug (ISSUE-007) blocked every profile edit and **passed its first test**,
   because a blocked update and a crashed update both return zero rows. Tests
   here assert stored state, never response shape.

High-value actions add a fifth check: writing or deleting a provider key
re-verifies the admin's password server-side, so a stolen session alone is not
enough.

---

## Secrets

```mermaid
graph LR
    K["Provider API key"] -->|"admin pastes it"| E["encryptSecret()"]
    E -->|"v1.iv.tag.ciphertext"| DB[("providers.encrypted_api_key")]
    DB -->|"per request"| DEC["decryptSecret()"]
    DEC --> ADP["adapter factory"]
    MK["ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY<br/>(env only, never in the DB)"] -.-> E
    MK -.-> DEC
    MK -.->|"HMAC"| TH["auth_attempts identifiers"]
```

AES-256-GCM, format `v1.<iv>.<tag>.<ciphertext>`. The version prefix means a
future algorithm change can read both formats and re-encrypt on write, rather
than needing a flag day. GCM is authenticated, so a tampered value throws instead
of decrypting to garbage. A fresh random IV per encryption — reusing one under
the same key breaks GCM catastrophically.

Keys are decrypted per request rather than cached, which is why adapters are
factories taking a key rather than singletons: a cached adapter would hold a key
that may since have been rotated.

---

## Theming

Seven presets × light/dark, resolved with **zero flash**. Both token blocks are
server-rendered, and a tiny inline script resolves `system` against the OS
setting before first paint. The cost is `'unsafe-inline'` in the CSP's
`script-src` — a nonce cannot be applied to that script without reintroducing
the flash. The trade is documented at the top of `next.config.ts` and remains an
open decision.

`npm run verify:theme` computes WCAG AA contrast for every token pairing in every
theme in both modes (134 checks) directly from the token data, so a new preset is
checked automatically rather than needing a new test.

---

## Verification

There is no unit-test framework and no test suite. What exists is a verification
harness of 39 `verify:*` scripts, each exercising the real database, the real
server or the real source, because the bugs this project has actually hit were not
the kind a mocked unit test catches. CI runs only the 11 credential-free scripts;
the rest need a database, a server or provider keys.

| Script | What it proves | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `verify:schema` | every table, view and function exists | DB |
| `verify:rls` | user A cannot read or write user B's rows | DB |
| `verify:gates` | anonymous and non-admin redirects | server |
| `verify:authz` | **no action or route was shipped without a gate** | — |
| `verify:headers` | the security header config | — |
| `verify:theme` | WCAG AA across every theme | — |
| `verify:appearance` | the theme is in the server-rendered HTML | DB + server |
| `verify:providers` | no vendor SDK or name escaped `lib/providers` | DB + keys |
| `verify:admin` | breaking **only the DB key** breaks chat — no silent env fallback | DB |
| `verify:security` | throttling, password rules, rate limit, token budget | DB |
| `verify:chat` | a real streamed completion end to end | DB + keys |
| `verify:email` | email templates render and meet contrast | — |
| `verify:compare` | one prompt to N models: refusals happen *before* spend | DB + keys |
| `verify:costs` | an answer's price is stored, linked, and not readable by anyone else | DB + keys |
| `verify:pages` | **every route rendered at 360/768/1440** — overflow, a11y, keyboard | DB + server |
| `verify:failures` | six induced failures, read off the screen a user sees | DB + server |
| `security:audit` | secret-shaped strings, advisories, RLS from the **pg catalog** | DB |
| `smoke` | a *running deployment*: headers as served, gates, assets | server |

Two patterns worth copying.

**Assert stored state, not response shape.** Several real bugs here produced
responses indistinguishable from success.

**Something has to open a page.** The four suites above the audit line are all
"does the value exist" checks, and 1,176 of them passed while the navigation was
unreachable on a phone — clipped away by an `overflow: hidden` with no scrollbar
to hint at it. A suite that renders is the only kind that can see that, and its
checks need breaking on purpose before they are believed: the obvious
horizontal-overflow test never fires in this layout, and finding that out took
deliberately widening an element to 2200px and watching the suite stay green.

---

## Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    DEV["local"] -->|"git push"| GH["GitHub · main"]
    GH -->|"Actions"| CI["lint · type-check · build<br/>credential-free suites"]
    GH -->|"auto-deploy"| RW["Railway"]
    RW --> APP["myaichat-production.up.railway.app"]
    CI -.->|"reports, does not block"| RW
```

CI and the deploy are **not chained**: Railway watches GitHub directly, so a red
build reports but does not prevent a deploy. Closing that needs branch
protection, which needs a paid plan on a private repository (ISSUE-018). The
workflow contains a Railway deploy job, deliberately disabled (`if: false`), with
the three steps to switch over written in place.

The build must not require runtime credentials — env parsing is lazy for exactly
this reason, and `env -i npx next build` is how that stays true (ISSUE-014).
